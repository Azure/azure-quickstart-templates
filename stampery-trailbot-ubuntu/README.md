This Ubuntu VM comes with a special demon called __Trailbot Watcher__ that monitors system files and logs, triggers __Smart Policies__ upon modification and generates a __blockchain-anchored__, __immutable audit trail__ of everything happening to them.

[Smart Policies](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies) are simple scripts that get called every time a tracked file changes. They trigger actions such as emailing someone, rolling files back or even shutting the system down. There are [plenty of them ready to use](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies#ready-to-use-policies), and you can even [create your own](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies).

You can manage your Smart Policies and audit trails by using the [Trailbot Client] desktop app.

All the files and logs watched in this VM will have the [Stamper Smart Policy](https://github.com/trailbot/stamper-policy) configured by default, so every time such files are modified, their hashes will be embedded in both the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains by using the [Stampery API](https://stampery.com/tech).
