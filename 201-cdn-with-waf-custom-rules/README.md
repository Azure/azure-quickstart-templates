This template creates a CDN Profile and a CDN Endpoint with a user specified origin and all of our most commonly used settings on CDN. This template also links a CDN WAF Policy to the Endpoint which applies example custom rules for blocking and redirecting requests based on geo-location, ip address, and SESSIONID header.
