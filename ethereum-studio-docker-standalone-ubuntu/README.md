# Deployment of Ethereum Studio docker in standalone mode

This template allows you to deploy an UbuntuServer 15.10 VM with Ethereum Studio docker in standalone mode.

Ethereum Studio is a web-based IDE for Ethereum developers. With the IDE you can write and compile your Solidity contracts, play with them in Sandbox, and then send the contracts to the real net.

This Ethereum Studio IDE works in standalone mode which means it does not have authentication and does not provide collaborative features.
