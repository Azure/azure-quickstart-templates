Create and configure Premium Redis Cache with both Virtual Network and optional clustering by using a template. Azure Virtual Network (VNET) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for your Azure Redis Cache, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access to Azure Redis Cache. Clustering provides the ability to automatically split your dataset among multiple nodes, the ability to continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster, more throughput, and more memory size.

For information about using this template, see [How to configure Virtual Network Support for a Premium Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cache-how-to-premium-vnet/).
