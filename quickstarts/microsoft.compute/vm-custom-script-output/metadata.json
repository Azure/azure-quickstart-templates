  "itemDisplayName": "Use output from a Custom Script Extension during Deployment",
  "description": "This is useful to the VM's compute to perform some task during deployment that Azure Resource Manager does not provide.  The output of that compute (script) can then be leveraged elsewhere in the deployment.  This is useful if the compute resource is needed in the deployment (e.g. a jumpbox, DC, etc), a bit wasteful if it is not.",
  "summary": "This sample shows how to get output from a custom script extension for use in deployment.  Additionally, it shows applying the custom script a second time in the same deployment.",
