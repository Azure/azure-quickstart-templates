This set of templates demonstrates how to create a hub workspace with customer-managed keys for encryption, and its data stored service-side. In this setup, public internet access is enabled, and _Microsoft_-managed identity is used. This preview capability overcomes the previous requirement for creating additional Azure Storage, Azure CosmosDB and Azure Search resources in your subscription when using customer-managed key encryption.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. 
> Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 

This configuration describes the set of resources required to:

1. (prerequisite) Create and configure an Azure Key vault resource to host an encryption key for Azure Machine Learning.
1. Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace of kind 'hub' and dependent resources, and then configure it for encryption with the above encryption key.

> [!NOTE]
> Previously, when using a customer-managed key, Azure Machine Learning creates a secondary resource group in your 
> subscription which contains additonal resources. With this preview, this is no longer needed and all service metadata
> will be encrypted service-side. This preview does not support Azure Key Vault that have public network access set as 'Disabled'.


**Preview:** 

Azure AI Studio is built on Azure Machine Learning as the primary resource provider and takes a dependency on the Cognitive Services (Azure AI Services) resource provider to surface model endpoints for Azure Speech, Azure Content Safety, And Azure OpenAI service.

An 'Azure AI hub' is a special kind of 'Azure Machine Learning workspace', that is of kind = "hub".

For AI services CMK configuration the following constraints hold on your encryption key:
- The selected key must be an RSA (Supported Json Web Key Types are ['RSA', 'RSA-HSM']) 2048 bit key. 
- No other key-size/asymmetric key-type is supported.
- Only Azure Key vault 'access policies' permission model is supported, not Azure RBAC.
- Encryption cannot be enforced on AI services at first template execution if AI services does not yet exist, because the system-assigned managed identity that will be created will need to be granted access to your key vault.
- Assign wrap/unwrap permissions on the AI services managed identity after creation. Then uncomment the encryption settings to enable encryption for AI services.

## Resources

| Provider and type | Description |
