## Network isolation architecture and isolation modes

When you enable managed virtual network isolation, a managed virtual network is created for the hub workspace. Any managed compute resources you create for the hub, for example the virtual machines of online endpoint managed deployment, will automatically use this managed virtual network. The managed virtual network can also utilize [Azure Private Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) for Azure resources that your hub depends on, such as Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Container Registry.

There are three different configuration modes for outbound traffic from the managed virtual network:

| Outbound mode                | Description                                                           | Scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Allow internet outbound      | Allow all internet outbound traffic from the managed virtual network. | You want unrestricted access to machine learning resources on the internet, such as python packages or pretrained models.                                                                                                                              |

| Disabled                     | Inbound and outbound traffic isn't restricted.                        | You want public inbound and outbound from the hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This set of [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/file) templates demonstrates how to deploy an Azure AI Studio environment with the hub workspace's managed network isolation mode configured to `Allow Internet Outbound`.

The [Azure Private Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) and [Private DNS Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.network/privatednszones) in the hub workspace managed virtual network are automatically created for you, while the Bicep templates create the [Azure Private Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) and relative [Private DNS Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.network/privatednszones) in the client virtual network.

## Managed Virtual Network

When you provision the hub workspace of your Azure AI Studio with an isolation mode equal to the [Allow Internet Outbound](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/configure-managed-network?tabs=portal#configure-a-managed-virtual-network-to-allow-internet-outbound) isolation mode, the managed virtual network and the Azure Private Endpoints to the dependent resources will not be created if public network access of Azure Key Vault, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Storage Account dependent resources is enabled.

The creation of the managed virtual network is deferred until a compute resource is created or provisioning is manually started. When allowing automatic creation, it can take around 30 minutes to create the first compute resource as it is also provisioning the network. For more information, see [Manually provision workspace managed VNet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-managed-network?view=azureml-api-2#manually-provision-a-managed-vnet).

If you initially create Azure Key Vault, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Storage Account dependent resources with public network enabled and then decide to disable it later, the managed virtual network will not be automatically provisioned if it is not already provisioned, and the private endpoints to the dependent resources will not be created.

In this case, if you want o create the private endpoints to the dependent resources, you need to reprovision the hub manage virtual network in one of the following ways:

- Redeploy the hub workspace using Bicep or Terraform templates. If the isolation mode is set to [Allow Internet Outbound](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/configure-managed-network?tabs=portal#configure-a-managed-virtual-network-to-allow-internet-outbound) and the dependent resources referenced by the hub workspace have public network access disabled, this operation will trigger the creation of the managed virtual network, if it does not already exist, and the private endpoints to the dependent resources.
- Execute the following Azure CLI command [az ml workspace provision-network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ml-workspace-provision-network) to reprovision the managed virtual network. The private endpoints will be created with the managed virtual network if the public network access of the dependent resources is disabled.

```bash
az ml workspace provision-network --name my_hub_workspace_name --resource-group
```

At this time, it's not possible to directly access the managed virtual network via the Azure CLI or the Azure Portal. You can see the managed virtual network indirectly by looking at the private endpoints, if any, under the hub workspace. You can proceed as follows:

1. Go to the Azure Portal and select your Azure AI hub.
2. Click on `Settings` and then `Networking`.
3. Open the `Workspace managed outbound access` tab.
4. Expand the section titled `Required outbound rules`.

Here, you will find the private endpoints that are connected to the resources within the hub managed virtual network. Ensure that these private endpoints are active.

![Workspace Managed Outbound Access](./images/hub-workspace.png)

You can also see the private endpoints hosted by the manage virtual network of your hub workspace inside the `Networking` settings of individual dependent resources, for example Key Vault:

1. Go to the Azure Portal and select your Azure Key Vault.
2. Click on `Settings` and then `Networking`.
3. Open the `Private endpoint connections` tab.

Here, you will find the private endpoint created by the Bicep templates in the client virtual network along with the private endpoint created in the hub managed virtual network of the hub. 

![Key Vault Private Enpoints](./images/key-vault.png)

Also note that when you create a hub workspace with the [Allow Internet Outbound](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/configure-managed-network?tabs=portal#configure-a-managed-virtual-network-to-allow-internet-outbound) isolation mode, the creation of the managed network is not immediate to save costs. The managed virtual network needs to be manually triggered via the [az ml workspace provision-network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ml/workspace?view=azure-cli-latest#az-ml-workspace-provision-network) command, or it will be triggered when you create a compute resource or private endpoints to dependent resources.

At this time, the creation of an online endpoint does not automatically trigger the creation of a managed virtual network. An error occurs if you try to create an online deployment under the workspace which enabled workspace managed VNet but the managed VNet is not provisioned yet. Workspace managed VNet should be provisioned before you create an online deployment. Follow instructions to manually provision the workspace managed VNet. Once completed, you may start creating online deployments. For more information, see Network isolation with managed online endpoint and Secure your managed online endpoints with network isolation.

## Limitations

The current limitations of managed virtual network are:

- Azure AI Studio currently doesn't support bringing your own virtual network, it only supports managed virtual network isolation.
- Once you enable managed virtual network isolation of your Azure AI, you can't disable it.
- Managed virtual network uses private endpoint connections to access your private resources. You can't have a private endpoint and a service endpoint at the same time for your Azure resources, such as a storage account. We recommend using private endpoints in all scenarios.
- The managed virtual network is deleted when the Azure AI is deleted.
- Data exfiltration protection is automatically enabled for the only approved outbound mode. If you add other outbound rules, such as to FQDNs, Microsoft can't guarantee that you're protected from data exfiltration to those outbound destinations.
- Using FQDN outbound rules increases the cost of the managed virtual network because FQDN rules use Azure Firewall. For more information, see [Pricing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/configure-managed-network?tabs=portal#pricing).
- FQDN outbound rules only support ports 80 and 443.
- When using a compute instance with a managed network, use the `az ml compute connect-ssh` command to connect to the compute using SSH.

## Pricing

According to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/configure-managed-network?tabs=portal#pricing), the hub managed virtual network feature is free. However, you will be charged for the following resources used by the managed virtual network:

- Azure Private Link - Private endpoints used to secure communications between the managed virtual network and Azure resources rely on Azure Private Link. For more information on pricing, see [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link/).
- FQDN outbound rules - FQDN outbound rules are implemented using Azure Firewall. If you use outbound FQDN rules, charges for Azure Firewall are included in your billing. Azure Firewall SKU is standard. Azure Firewall is provisioned per hub.

> [!NOTE]
> The firewall isn't created until you add an outbound FQDN rule. If you don't use FQDN rules, you will not be charged for Azure Firewall. For more information on pricing, see [Azure Firewall pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-firewall/).

## Secure Access to the Jumpbox Virtual Machine

The jumpbox virtual machine is deployed with Windows 11 operating system and the `Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory` VM extension, a specialized extension for integrating Azure virtual machines (VMs) with Microsoft Entra ID. This integration provides several key benefits, particularly in enhancing security and simplifying access management. Here's an overview of what the Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory VM extension offers:

`Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory` VM extension is specialized for integrating Azure virtual machines (VMs) with Microsoft Entra ID. This integration provides several key benefits, particularly in enhancing security and simplifying access management. Here's an overview of the features and benefits of this VM extension:

- Enables users to sign in to a Windows or Linux virtual machine using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials.
- Facilitates single sign-on (SSO) experiences, reducing the need for managing separate local VM accounts.
- Supports multi-factor authentication, increasing security by requiring additional verification steps during login.
- Integrates with Azure RBAC, allowing administrators to assign specific roles to users, thereby controlling the level of access and permissions on the virtual machine.
- Allows administrators to apply conditional access policies to the VM, enhancing security by enforcing controls such as trusted device requirements, location-based access, and more.
- Eliminates the need to manage local administrator accounts, simplifying VM management and reducing overhead.

For more information, see [Sign in to a Windows virtual machine in Azure by using Microsoft Entra ID including passwordless](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows).

Make sure to enforce multi-factor authentication on your user account in your Microsoft Entra ID Tenant, as shown in the following screenshot:

![Multi-factor Authentication](./images/mfa.png)

Then, specify at least an authentication method in addition to the password for the user account, for example the phone number, as shown in the following screenshot:

![Authentication Methods](./images/authentication-methods.png)

To log in to the jumpbox virtual machine using a Microsoft Entra ID tenant user, you need to assign one of the following Azure roles to determine who can access the VM. To assign these roles, you must have the [Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-data-access-administrator-preview) role, or any role that includes the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` action, such as the [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) role. If you choose a role other than the Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator, it is recommended to [add a condition to limit the permission to create role assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/delegate-role-assignments-overview).

- [Virtual Machine Administrator Login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/compute#virtual-machine-administrator-login): Users who have this role assigned can sign in to an Azure virtual machine with administrator privileges.
- [Virtual Machine User Login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/compute#virtual-machine-user-login): Users who have this role assigned can sign in to an Azure virtual machine with regular user privileges.

To allow a user to sign in to the jumpbox virtual machine over RDP, you must assign the `Virtual Machine Administrator Login` or `Virtual Machine User Login` role to the user at the subscription, resource group, or virtual machine level. The `virtualMachine.bicep` module assigns the `Virtual Machine Administrator Login` to the user identified by the `userObjectId` parameter.

To log in to the jumpbox virtual machine via Azure Bastion Host using a Microsoft Entra ID tenant user with multi-factor authentication, you can use the [az network bastion rdp](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/bastion?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-bastion-rdp) command as follows:

```bash
az network bastion rdp \
    --name <bastion-host-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
    --target-resource-id <virtual-machine-resource-id> \
    --auth-type AAD
```

After logging in to the virtual machine, if you open the Edge browser and navigate to the Azure Portal or Azure AI Studio, the browser profile will automatically be configured to the tenant user account used for the VM login.

## Bicep Parameters
