This set of templates demonstrates how to set up Azure AI Foundry with a basic configuration, meaning with public internet access enabled, Microsoft-managed keys for encryption and _Microsoft_-managed identity configuration for the AI hub resource.

Azure AI Foundry is built on Azure Machine Learning as the primary resource provider and takes a dependency on the Cognitive Services (Azure AI Services) resource provider to surface model-as-a-service endpoints for Azure Speech, Azure Content Safety, And Azure OpenAI service.

An 'Azure AI hub' is a special kind of 'Azure Machine Learning workspace', that is kind = "hub".

## Resources

| Provider and type | Description |
| - | - |
| `Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups` | The resource group all resources get deployed into |
| `Microsoft.Insights/components` | An Azure Application Insights instance associated to the Azure Machine Learning workspace |
| `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults` | An Azure Key Vault instance associated to the Azure Machine Learning workspace |
| `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` | An Azure Storage instance associated to the Azure Machine Learning workspace |
| `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries` | An Azure Container Registry instance associated to the Azure Machine Learning workspace |
| `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces` | An Azure AI hub (Azure Machine Learning RP workspace of kind 'hub') |
| `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | An Azure AI Services as the model-as-a-service endpoint provider (allowed kinds: 'AIServices' and 'OpenAI') |
