  "summary": "Creates a Virtual Machine and deployes SAP HANA Express with all dependencies into the VM. Before you can use this quickstart template, you need to download the SAP HANA Express setup packages from SAP (https://www.sap.com/developer/topics/sap-hana-express.html) and upload them into an Azure Storage Account. The quick start template helps with that by providing a script that uploads the HANA Express setup packages into a storage account it creates for you.",
