# Azure Resource Manager QuickStart Templates

This repo contains all currently available Azure Resource Manager templates contributed by the community. A searchable template index is maintained at [azure.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?expanded=azure&products=azure-resource-manager).

See the [**Contribution guide**](/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/README.md#contribution-guide) for how to use or contribute to this repo.

## Policies for Samples
### Policy: No External Links

We will reject PRs or remove samples that contain links to non-Microsoft controlled assets, to avoid the risk of potential domain spoofing or hostile takeover. Examples include S3 buckets, non-Microsoft owned Azure storage accounts or non-Azure git repositories.

To fix this, either use Bicep with [modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/modules) & [file functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-functions-files), or parameterize links to external content.
