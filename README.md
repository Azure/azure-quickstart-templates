## Policies for Samples
### Policy: No External Links

We will reject PRs or remove samples that contain links to non-Microsoft controlled assets, to avoid the risk of potential domain spoofing or hostile takeover. Examples include S3 buckets, non-Microsoft owned Azure storage accounts or non-Azure git repositories.

To fix this, either use Bicep with [modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/modules) & [file functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-functions-files), or parameterize links to external content.
