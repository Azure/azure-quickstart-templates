CoScale is a full-stack monitoring solution tailored towards production environments running microservices, see https://www.coscale.com/ for more information.
This template installs the CoScale platform on a single VM and should only be used for Proof-Of-Concept environments.

This template automatically creates all required objects, such as a storage account, virtual network, nic, load balancer, public ip.

The following parameters should be provided by the user:

* coscaleKey: a CoScale registration key that can be retrieved at https://www.coscale.com/azure/
* coscaleEmail: email address for the super user on your private CoScale instance
* coscalePassword: password for the super user on your private CoScale instance

Once the template finishes it will output the URL of your private CoScale instance.

## Install agent

This directory also contains a deploy-agent.sh script to deploy the CoScale agent on all VMs in a resource group.

## Limitations

- This single VM deployment should only be used for Proof-Of-Concept environments.
- There is no backup of the data that is collected using this setup.
- Since the created objects have fixed names they can be deployed only once per resource group.
