description: This template deploys a 3 node Consul cluster and auto-joins the nodes via Atlas. Consul is a tool for service discovery, distributed key/value store and a bunch of other cool things. Atlas is provided by Hashicorp (makers of Consul) as a way to quickly create Consul clusters without having to manually join each node

This will create a 3 node [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) cluster in Azure and put them into an internal load balancer.

**NOTE** you will need to have an [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) account and token in order for auto-join to work.

The Atlas documentation on how to create a token is located [here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/help/user-accounts/authentication)

This template is a bit odd as it gives each of the 3 nodes a public IP but then blocks all incoming traffic. Consul should probably be something you use internally (not publicly accessible) but I didn't want to include spinning up a NAT box just for this. The hack is to give each box a public IP and then block off everything from the outside world accept for SSH. That is why the load balancer is internal as the idea is only internal resources will be using it.
