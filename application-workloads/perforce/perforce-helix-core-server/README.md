This template creates a Perforce Helix Core server using best practice Server Deployment Package (SDP):

- [Perforce Helix Core Server Version Control](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core)
- [SDP - Server Deployment Package](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-sdp)

It is a single VM instance with a single Data volume.

The parameters which can be user configured in the parameters file include:

* `OS` (default "CentOS 7.x") - one of: "CentOS 7.x" (7.8+), "RHEL 7.x" (7.8+), "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS"
* `adminUsername` (default "p4admin") - username to use with ssh to access the VM.
* `adminSSHPubKey` (default None) - For access to VM via ssh for account `adminUsername`. This is required.
* `helix_admin_password` (default None) - p4d password for above user. This is required.
* `source_CIDR` (default "0.0.0.0/0") - Source IP access list - for security we *strongly recommend* you consider only allowing specific whitelisted IP addresses to access the server
* `VMSize` (default "Standard_B2s" - suitable for testing only) - Select one of the [Azure Linux Instance types](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-general) with appropriate vCPUs and RAM for your needs. We recommend Compute optimized instances for production use, e.g. Fsv2 series options such as "Standard_F4s_v2". See KB link in More Details section below for further discussion.
* `dataDiskSize` (default 50) - Size in GB of data volume where all metadata/logs/depot files are stored. Up to 2TB (2048GB) is supported.
* `p4Port` (default 1666) - P4PORT value to access p4d service. Note SSL is not optional.

# After Installation

You will be able to connect to the provisioned instance with a P4PORT of format `ssl:<IP Adress>:1666` as user `perforce` (or <helix_admin_userame> parameter) with the configured password file using a standard Helix

You can ssh to the instance for more detailed configuration if you wish: `ssh <adminUsername>@<IP address>`

Please see KB link below.

# P4D License Installation

The instance is unlicensed, so initially will be limited to 5 users and 20 workspaces. You can buy a license by following the instructions at the KB link below.
