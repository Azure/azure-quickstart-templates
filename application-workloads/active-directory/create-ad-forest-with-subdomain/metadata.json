  "description": "This template creates a new Active Directory forest, with an optional subdomain. You can choose to have either one or two DCs per domain. The network configuration is highly configurable, making it suitable to fit into an existing environment. The VMs use managed disks and have no dependency on storage accounts. As an operating system you can choose between Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. This template illustrates the use of nested templates, Powershell DSC, and other advanced concepts.",
