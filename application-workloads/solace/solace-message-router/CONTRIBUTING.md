## How to contribute to a Solace Project

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/azure-quickstart-templates/solace-message-router/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/azure-quickstart-templates/solace-message-router/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a GitHub [enhancement request issue](https://github.com/azure-quickstart-templates/solace-message-router/issues/new) and describe the new functionality.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the code or how to use Solace messaging in the [Solace community](http://dev.solace.com/community/).
