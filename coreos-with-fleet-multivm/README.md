This template allows you to create a CoreOS cluster with Fleet deployed and started on each cluster node. This template also deploys a Storage Account, Virtual Network, Public IP addresses and a Network Interface.

You will need to provide a key pair for authentication to the nodes as well as provide a discoveryUrl for the Fleet cluster.

Step-1: Generate a OpenSSH Key Pair. You will get a public and private key. The private key will be of the format : -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----base64encodedprivatekey-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Step-2: Now use openssl to get a public certificate for the generated private key. The following sample command should help you do that: openssl.exe req -x509 -days 365 -new -key "<Path>\privatekeyopenssh.pem" -out "publickeycert.cer" -config openssl.cnf. The certificate generated should be this format - -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----base64encodedpublickey-----END CERTIFICATE-----

Step-3: In the template file, you need to pass the base64encodedpublickey (after stripping off Begin and End Certificate header) as the sshKeyData value.

Note: In the next few weeks, we will make a breaking API change to update the APIs to accept the sshKeyData in the following format - ssh-rsa <publickey> keyComment.

The discoveryUrl specifies the url where the Fleet cluster keeps internal configuration information. Each Fleet cluster must have a unique discoveryUrl. This URL is generated by the following URL: [https://discovery.etcd.io/new](https://discovery.etcd.io/new). This web page generates a discoveryUrl like the following, with the random string identifying this cluster uniquely:

https://discovery.etcd.io/dcf78d9803b417e1a3eeb15987bdf82f

This discoveryUrl must be copied in its entirety into the discoveryUrl parameter.

Below are the parameters that the template expects

| Name   | Description    |
|:--- |:---|
| location | location where the resources will be deployed |
| newStorageAccountName | new storage account for the VMs OS disk |
| vmSize | Instance size for the VMs |
| numberOfNodes | Number of CoreOS compute nodes to deploy |
| adminUsername | Name of the admin user |
| sshKeyData | Explained above |
| discoveryUrl | Explained above |
