# Create a data management gateway and make it workable in azure VM

Before deploying the template you must have the following

1. **Data Factory.** The gateway is created in the data factory. If you don't have a data factory,  see the [Create data factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud#create-data-factory) for steps to create one.
2. **Virtual Network.** The virtual machine will join this VNET. If you don't have one, use this tutorial, see [Create virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal#create-a-virtual-network) to create one.

When you deploy this Azure Resource Template, you will create a logical gateway in your data factory and the following resources
- Azure Virtual Machine 
- Azure Storage Account (for boot diagnostic)
- Public IP Address
- Network Interface
- Network Sercurity Group

This template can help you create a gateway and make it workable in azure VM. The VM must join in an exsiting VNET. You will see the new gateway is online after successful deployment.
