## Best practices

+ It is a good practice to pass your template through a JSON linter to remove extraneous commas, parenthesis, brackets that may break the "Deploy to Azure" experience. Try http://jsonlint.com/ or a linter package for your favorite editing environment (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, Visual Studio etc.)
+ It's also a good idea to format your JSON for better readability. You can use a JSON formatter package for your local editor or [format online using this link](https://www.bing.com/search?q=json+formatter).
+ A starter template is provided [here](/100-STARTER-TEMPLATE-with-VALIDATION) for you to follow.

The following guidelines are relevant to the main deployment template and nested templates (if used).

1. Template parameters should follow **camelCasing**.
1. Minimize parameters whenever possible, this allows for a good "hello world" experience where the user doesn't have to answer a number of questions to complete a deployment.  If you can use a variable or a literal, do so.  Users who want to parameterize something will likely have the skills to do so. Only provide parameters for:
 + Things that are globally unique (e.g. website name).  These are usually endpoints that the user may need to be aware of. However, in many cases a unique name can be generated automatically by using the [uniqueString()](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-functions/#uniquestring) template language function.
 + Other things a user must know to complete a workflow (e.g. admin user name on a VM)
 + Secrets (e.g. admin password on a VM)
 + If you must include a parameter, define a defaultValue, unless the parameter is used for a password.
1. Every parameter in the template should have the **lower-case description** tag specified using the metadata property. This looks like below

 ```
 "parameters": {
   "storageAccountType": {
     "type": "string",
     "metadata": {
     "description": "The type of the new storage account created to store the VM disks"
     }
   }
 }
 ```
 
1. Do not use a parameter to specify the **location**. Use the location property of the resourceGroup instead. By using the **resourceGroup().location** expression for all your resources, the resources in the template will automatically be deployed in the same location as the resource group.

 ```
 "resources": [
   {
     "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
     "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
     "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
     "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
     "comments": "This storage account is used to store the VM disks",
     "properties": {
       "accountType": "Standard_GRS"
     }
   }
 ]
 ```
 + If you must use a location parameter, share parameters whenever possible - e.g. the location parameter should be shared among resources that must or are likely to be in the same location.

1. Name **variables** using this scheme **templateScenarioResourceName** (e.g. simpleLinuxVMVNET, userRoutesNSG, elasticsearchPublicIP etc.) that describe the scenario rather. This ensures when a user browses all the resources in the Portal there aren't a bunch of resources with the same name (e.g. myVNET, myPublicIP, myNSG)

1. Do not create a parameter for a **storage account name**. Storage account names need to be lower case and can't contain hyphens (-) in addition to other domain name restrictions. A storage account has a limit of 24 characters. They also need to be globally unique. To prevent any validation issue configure a variables (using the expression **uniqueString** and a static value **storage**). Storage accounts with a common prefix (uniqueString) will not get clustered on the same racks.
	
 ```
 "variables": {
 	"storageAccountName": "[concat(uniqueString(resourceGroup().id),'storage')]"
 }
 ```
 
 Note: Templates should consider storage accounts throughput constraints and deploy across multiple storage accounts where necessary. Templates should distribute virtual machine disks across multiple storage accounts to avoid platform throttling.

1. For many resources with a resource group, a name is not often relevant and using something a hard coded string "availabilitySet" may be acceptable.  You can also use variables for the name of a resource and generate names for resources with globally unique names. Use **displayName** tags for a "friendly" name in the JSON outline view.  This should ideally match the name property value or property name.

 ```
 "resources": [
   {
     "name": "availabilitySet",
     "type": "Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets",
     "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
     "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
     "tags": { "displayName": "appTierAS" },
     "properties": {
        ...
     }
   }
 ]
 ```
	
1. Specifying a lower-case **comments** property for each resource in the template helps other contributors to understand the purpose of the resource.

 ```	
 "resources": [
   {
     "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
     "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
     "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
     "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
     "comments": "This storage account is used to store the VM disks",
     "properties": {
       "accountType": "Standard_GRS"
     }
   }
 ]
 ```

1. If you use a **public endpoint** in your template (e.g. blob storage public endpoint), **do not hardcode** the namespace. Use the **reference** function to retrieve the namespace dynamically. This allows you to deploy the template to different public namespace environments, without the requirement to change the endpoint in the template manually. Use the following reference to specify the osDisk. Define a variable for the storageAccountName (as specified in the previous example), a variable for the vmStorageAccountContainerName and a variable for the OSDiskName. Set the apiVersion to the same version you are using for the storageAccount in your template.

 ```
 "osDisk": {"name": "osdisk","vhd": {"uri": "[concat(reference(concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', 
 variables('storageAccountName')), '2015-06-15').primaryEndpoints.blob, variables('vmStorageAccountContainerName'),
 '/',variables('OSDiskName'),'.vhd')]"}}
 ```

 If you have other values in your template configured with a public namespace, change these to reflect the same reference function. For example the storageUri property of the virtual machine diagnosticsProfile. Set the apiVersion to the same version you are using for the corresponding resource in your template.

 ```
 "diagnosticsProfile": {"bootDiagnostics": {"enabled": "true","storageUri":
 "[reference(concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName')), 
 '2015-06-15').primaryEndpoints.blob]"}}
 ```
 
 You can also **reference** an **existing storage account** in a different resource group. Set the apiVersion to the same version you are using for the existing storageAccount.

 ```
 "osDisk": {"name": "osdisk", "vhd": {"uri":"[concat(reference(resourceId(parameters('existingResourceGroup'), 
 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', parameters('existingStorageAccountName')), '2015-06-15').primaryEndpoints.blob, 
 variables('vmStorageAccountContainerName'),
 '/',variables('OSDiskName'),'.vhd')]"}}
 ```
 
10. **Passwords** must be passed into parameters of type **securestring**. Do not specify a defaultValue for a parameter that is used for a password or an SSH key. Passwords must also be passed to **customScriptExtension** using the **commandToExecute** property in protectedSettings.

 ```
 "properties": {
 	"publisher": "Microsoft.OSTCExtensions",
 	"type": "CustomScriptForLinux",
 	"settings": {
 		"fileUris": [
 			"[concat(variables('template').assets, '/lamp-app/install_lamp.sh')]"
 		]
 	},
 	"protectedSettings": {
 		"commandToExecute": "[concat('sh install_lamp.sh ', parameters('mySqlPassword'))]"
 	}
 }
 ```

 Note: In order to ensure that secrets which are passed as parameters to virtualMachines/extensions are encrypted, the protectedSettings property of the relevant extensions must be used.
 
11. Using tags to add metadata to resources allows you to add additional information about your resources. A good use case for tags is adding metadata to a resource for billing detail purposes. 

12. You can group variables into complex objects. You can reference a value from a complex object in the format variable.subentry (e.g. `"[variables('storage').storageAccounts.type]"`). Grouping variables helps you keep track of related variables and improves readability of the template.

 ```
 "variables": {
 	"storage": {
 		"storageAccounts": {
 		"name": "[concat(uniqueString(resourceGroup().id),'storage')]",
 		"type": "Standard_LRS"
 		}
 	}
 },
 "resources": [
	 {
	 "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
	 "name": "[variables('storage').storageAccounts.name]",
	 "apiVersion": "[2015-06-15]",
	 "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
	 "properties": {
	 	"accountType": "[variables('storage').storageAccounts.type]"
	 }
 	 }
 ]
 ```

 Note: A complex object cannot contain an expression that references a value from a complex object. Define a separate variable for this purpose.

13. The **domainNameLabel** property for publicIPAddresses must be **unique**. domainNameLabel is required to be betweeen 3 and 63 characters long and to follow the rules specified by this regular expression ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,61}[a-z0-9]$. As the uniqueString function will generate a string that is 13 characters long in the example below it is presumed that the dnsPrefixString prefix string has been checked to be no more than 50 characters long and to conform to those rules.

 ```
 "parameters": {
 	"dnsPrefixString": {
 		"type": "string",
 		"maxLength": 50,
		"metadata": {
 			"description": "DNS Label for the Public IP. Must be lowercase. It should match with the following regular expression: ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,61}[a-z0-9]$ or it will raise an error."
 		}
 	}
 },
 "variables": {
 	"dnsPrefix": "[concat(parameters('dnsPrefixString'),uniquestring(resourceGroup().id))]"
 }
 ```

14. If a template creates any new **publicIPAddresses** then it should have an **output** section that provides details of the IP address and fully qualified domain created to easily retrieve these details after deployment. 

 ```
 "outputs": {
 "fqdn": {
 	"value": "[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses',parameters('publicIPAddressName')),providers('Microsoft.Network', 'publicIPAddresses').apiVersions[0]).dnsSettings.fqdn]",
 	"type": "string"
 },
 "ipaddress": {
 	"value": "[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses',parameters('publicIPAddressName')),providers('Microsoft.Network', 'publicIPAddresses').apiVersions[0]).ipAddress]",
  	"type": "string"
 }
}
```

15. publicIPAddresses assigned to a Virtual Machine instance should only be used when these are required for application purposes, for connectivity to the resources for debug, management or administrative purposes either inboundNatRules, virtualNetworkGateways or a jumpbox should be used.

## Single template or nested templates

It is obvious to create a single deployment template for deploying a single resource. Nested templates are common for more advanced scenarios. The following section is by no means a hard requirement, but more of a guidance to help you decide between a single template or a decomposed nested template design. 

* Create a single template for a single tier application
* Create a nested templates deployment for a multitier application
* Use nested templates for conditional deployment

### Samples that contain extra artifacts (Custom Scripts, nested templates, etc)

When samples contain scripts, templates or other artifacts that need to be made available during deployment, using the standard parameters for staging those artifacts will enable command line deployment with the scripts provided at the root of the repository.  This allows the template to be used in a variety of workflows without changing the templates or default parameters and the artifacts will be staged to a private location, rather than the public GitHub URI.

First, define two standard parameters:

* _artifactsLocation - this is the base URI where all artifacts for the deployment will be staged.  The default value should be the samples folder so that the sample can be easily deployed in scenarios where a private location is not required.
* _artifactsocationSasToken - this is the sasToken required to access _artifactsLocation.  The default value should be "" for scenarios where the _artifactsLocation is not secured, for example, the raw GitHub URI.

```
  "parameters": {
      "_artifactsLocation": {
          "type": "string",
          "metadata": {
              "description": "The base URI where artifacts required by this template are located. When the template is deployed using the accompanying scripts, a private location in the subscription will be used and this value will be automatically generated."
          },
          "defaultValue": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/201-vm-custom-script-windows/"
      },
      "_artifactsLocationSasToken": {
          "type": "securestring",
          "metadata": {
              "description": "The sasToken required to access _artifactsLocation.  When the template is deployed using the accompanying scripts, a sasToken will be automatically generated."
          },
          "defaultValue": ""
      }
  },

```
In this example, the custom script extension can be authored using a common pattern that can be applied to all resources that need staged artifacts as well as applied to all samples.

```
  "properties": {
      "publisher": "Microsoft.Compute",
      "type": "CustomScriptExtension",
      "typeHandlerVersion": "1.8",
      "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
      "settings": {
      "fileUris": [
          "[concat(parameters('_artifactsLocation'), '/', variables('ScriptFolder'), '/', variables('ScriptFileName'), parameters('_artifactsLocationSasToken'))]"
        ],
      "commandToExecute": "[concat('powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File ', variables('ScriptFolder'), '/', variables('ScriptFileName'))]"
        }
  }
``` 

### Nested templates

Nested templates that link to templates within the same sample can be authored using the same pattern described above for scripts.

```
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "shared",
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
      "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
      "properties": {
        "mode": "Incremental",
        "templateLink": {
          "uri": "[concat(parameters('_artifactsLocation'), '/', variables('nestedTemplateFolder'), '/', variables('nestedTemplateFileName'), parameters('_artifactsLocationSasToken'))]",
          "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
```


When authoring a template that references another sample, define a complex object variable in the azuredeploy.json that contains the absolute URI of the repository folder. Add a relative path entry in that variable for each nested template you are using in your deployment. This gives quick overview of the nested templates referenced in your resources. Store all nested templates in the **nestedtemplates** folder. The templatelink in the resource combines the absolute URI with the relative path. When you fork a repository you only need to update the absolute URI in the azuredeploy.json file. 

```
"variables": {
  "template": {
    "base": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-create-availability-set",
    "shared": "nestedtemplates/sharedresources.json"
  }
},
"resources": [
  {
    "name": "shared",
    "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
    "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
    "properties": {
      "mode": "Incremental",
      "templateLink": {
        "uri": "[concat(variables('template').base, variables('template').shared)]",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
]
```


_**Note:** Using this approach will still require pulling the dependent artifact from the raw GitHub location.  The sample scripts do not privately stage artifacts from adjacent solutions.  In practice, it is expected that this technique would be rarely used because the main template being deployed has a dependency on a shared template that may have a different lifecycle, resulting in unexpected changes in the configuration.  In a real-world scenario, all the templates that make up the deployment should be under the same span of control and could be staged together.  Simply put share the same parent.  This will work for a shared environment of the repository, but a best practice would be to refactor these samples to ensure a proper configuration is maintained._


It is possible to deploy a nested template based on parameter input. The parameter input is used to concatenate the relative path to a nested template. Based on the user input a different template is deployed. This enables a conditional nested template deployment. The paramater is used to define the name of the template. Ensure the allowedValues of the input parameter match the names of the nested templates.

### Nested templates design for more advanced scenarios

When you decide to decompose your template design into multiple nested templates, the following guidelines will help to standardize the design. These guidelines are based on the [best practices for designing Azure Resource Manager templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/best-practices-resource-manager-design-templates/) documentation.
For this guidance a deployment of a SharePoint farm is used as an example. The SharePoint farm consists of multiple tiers. Each tier can be created with high availability. The recommended design consists of the following templates.

+ **Main template** (azuredeploy.json). Used for the input parameters.
+ **Shared resouces template**. Deploys the shared resources that all other resources use (e.g. virtual network, availability sets). The expression dependsOn enforces that this template is deployed before the other templates.
+ **Optional resources template**. Conditionally deploys resources based on a parameter (e.g. a jumpbox)
+ **Member resources templates**. Each within an application tier within has its own configuration. Within a tier different instance types can be defined. (e.g. first instance creates a new cluster, additional instances are added to the existing cluster). Each instance type will have its own deployment template.
+ **Scripts**. Widely reusable scripts are applicable for each instance type (e.g. initialize and format additional disks). Custom scripts are created for specific customization purpose are different per instance type.

![alt text](images/nestedTemplateDesign.png "Nested templates design")
 
The **main template** is stored in the **root** of the folder, the **other templates** are stored in the **nestedtemplates** folder. The scripts are stored in the **scripts** folder.
