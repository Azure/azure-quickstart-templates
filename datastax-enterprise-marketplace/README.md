This template deploys a DataStax Enterprise (DSE) cluster to Azure running on Ubuntu virtual machines. The template also provisions a storage account, virtual network, public IP address and the network interfaces required by the installation.

The template expects the following parameters:

| Name   | Description |
|:--- |:---|
| clusterName | The name of the new cluster |
| region | Region where the Azure artifacts will be created |
| clusterNodeCount | The number of virtual machines to provision for the cluster |
| clusterVmSize | The size of virtual machine to provision for each cluster node |
| adminUsername  | Admin user name for the virtual machines |
| adminPassword  | Admin password for the virtual machines |
| datastaxUsername | Your DataStax account username.  You can register at http://www.datastax.com/download |
| datastaxPassword | Your DataStax account password.  You can register at http://www.datastax.com/download |

Once the Azure VMs, virtual network and storage are setup, the template installs prerequisites like Java on the DSE nodes.  These have static IPs starting at 10.0.0.6 which are accessible on the internal virtual network.  

The template also sets up a node to run DataStax OpsCenter.  This node has the internal IP 10.0.0.5 as well as an external IP.  Ports 22 (SSH), 8888 (HTTP), and 8443 (HTTPS) are enabled.

The script opscenter.sh installs OpsCenter and creates a cluster using OpsCenter.  These cluster creation process installs DSE on all the cluster nodes and starts it up.  

On completion, OpsCenter will be accessible at `http://{clusterName}.{region}.cloudapp.azure.com:8888` For instance, if you created a deployment with the clusterName parameter set to datastax in the West US region you could access OpsCenter for the deployment at `http://datastax.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:8888`  The default username and password for OpsCenter is admin.
