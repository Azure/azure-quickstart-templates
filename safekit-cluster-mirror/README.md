![How the Evidian SafeKit mirror cluster implements real-time replication and failover in Azure?](images/mirrorarch.png)

On the previous figure,

*   the critical application is running on the PRIM server
*   users are connected to a primary/secondary virtual IP address which is configured in the Azure load balancer
*   SafeKit brings a generic health probe for the load balancer. On the PRIM server, the health probe returns OK to the load balancer and NOK on the SECOND server.
*   in each server, SafeKit monitors the critical application with process checkers and custom checkers
*   SafeKit restarts automatically the critical application when there is a **software failure** or a **hardware failure** thanks to restart scripts
*   SafeKit makes synchronous real-time replication of files containing critical data
*   a connector for the SafeKit web console is installed in each server. Thus, the high availability cluster can be managed in a very simple way to avoid **human errors**

## <a name="resources"></a>Deployed resources

In term of VMs, this template deploys:

*   2 VMs (Windows or Linux) spanning 2 availability zones
*   each VM has a public IP address
*   the SafeKit free trial is installed in both VMs
*   a SafeKit mirror module is configured in both VMs

In term of load balancer, this template deploys:

*   a public load balancer (standard SKU)
*   a public IP (Standard SKU) is associated with the public load balancer and plays the role of the virtual IP
*   both VMs are in the backend pool of the load balancer
*   a health probe checks the mirror module state on both VMs
*   a load balancing rule for external port 9453 / internal port 9453 is set to test the primary/secondary virtual IP

## <a name="use"></a>How to use

Click the "Deploy to Azure" button at the beginning of this document to deploy the high availability cluster. Please create a new resource group.

After deployment, go to the resource groups's deployment ('Microsoft.Template') output panel and:

*   visit the credential url to install the client and CA certificates in your web browser
*   after certificates installation, start the web console of the cluster
*   test the primary/secondary virtual IP address with the test URL in the output
