.NAME
    SPInstall

# Description
    
    **Type:** Common
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is used to install the SharePoint binaries. The BinaryDir
    parameter should point to the path that setup.exe is located (not to setup.exe
    itself). The ProductKey parameter is used to inject in to the configuration
    file and validate the license key during the installation process. This module
    depends on the prerequisites already being installed, which can be done
    
    NOTE:
    This resource only supports SharePoint Server. SharePoint Foundation
    is not supported. For examples to install SharePoint Foundation using DSC, see:
    https://github.com/PowerShell/SharePointDsc/wiki/SPInstall (Example 3)
    
    ## Installing from network locations
    
    If you wish to install SharePoint from a network location this can
    be done, however you must disable User Account Control (UAC) on the server
    to allow DSC to run the executable from a remote location, and also set
    the PsDscRunAsCredential value to run as an account with local admin
    permissions as well as read access to the network location.
    
    It is *not recommended* to disable UAC for security reasons. The recommended
    approach is to copy the installation media to the local nodes first and
    then execute the installation from there.
    
    ## Multilingual support
    
    Where possible, resources in SharePointDsc have been written in a way that
    they should support working with multiple language packs for multilingual
    deployments. However due to constraints in how we set up and install the
    product, only English ISOs are supported for installing SharePoint.

.EXAMPLE
    This module will install SharePoint to the default locations. The binaries for
    SharePoint in this scenario are stored at C:\SPInstall (so it will look to run
    C:\SPInstall\Setup.exe)


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPInstall InstallBinaries
            {
                IsSingleInstance = "Yes"
                BinaryDir        = "C:\SPInstall"
                ProductKey       = "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
            }
        }
    }


.EXAMPLE
    This module will install SharePoint to the specific locations set for the
    InstallPath and DataPath directories.


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPInstall InstallBinaries
            {
                IsSingleInstance = "Yes"
                BinaryDir        = "D:\SharePoint\Binaries"
                InstallPath      = "D:\SharePoint\Install"
                DataPath         = "D:\SharePoint\Data"
                ProductKey       = "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
            }
        }
    }


.EXAMPLE
    This module will install SharePoint Foundation 2013 to the local server


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

        node localhost {
            Package InstallSharePointFoundation
            {
                Ensure             = "Present"
                Name               = "Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013 Core"
                Path               = "E:\SharePoint2013\Setup.exe"
                Arguments          = "/config E:\SharePoint2013\files\setupfarmsilent\config.xml"
                ProductID          = "90150000-1014-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE"
                ReturnCode         = 0
