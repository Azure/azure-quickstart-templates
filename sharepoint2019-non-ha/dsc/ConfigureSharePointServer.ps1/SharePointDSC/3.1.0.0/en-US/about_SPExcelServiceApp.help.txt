            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {

            {
                Name            = "Excel Services Service Application"

    removing a service app and as such can be ignored and set to any value. 


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param(

            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPExcelServiceApp ExcelServices
            {
                Name            = "Excel Services Service Application"
                ApplicationPool = "n/a"
                Ensure          = "Absent"
