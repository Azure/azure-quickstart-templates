# Description
    
    **Type:** Distributed
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is used to manage SharePoint Service Application Proxy Groups.
    The "Ensure" parameter controls whether or not the Proxy Group should exist. A
    proxy group cannot be removed if a web application is using it. The
    "ServiceAppProxies" property will set a specific list of Service App Proxies
    to be members of this Proxy Group. It will add and remove proxies to ensure
    the group matches this list exactly. The "ServiceAppProxiesToInclude" and
    "ServiceAppProxiesToExclude" properties will allow you to add and remove
    proxies from the group, leaving other proxies that are in the group but not in
    either list intact.
    
    Use the proxy group name "Default" to manipulate the default proxy group.
    
    Requirements:
    At least one of the ServiceAppProxies, ServiceAppProxiesToInclude or
    ServiceAppProxiesToExclude properties needs to be specified. Do not combine
    the ServiceAppProxies property with the ServiceAppProxiesToInclude and
    
    The default value for the Ensure parameter is Present. When not specifying this
    parameter, the proxy group is created.
