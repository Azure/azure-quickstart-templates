    of the BCS app through the application display name. Currently the resource
    will provision the app if it does not yet exist, and will change the service
    account associated to the app if it does not match the configuration. Database
    names or server name will not be changed if the configuration does not match,
    these parameters are only used for the initial provisioning of the service
    application.

    parameter, the service application is provisioned.

.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to deploy a Business Connectivity Services application to the
    local SharePoint farm. The application pool account is mandatory but the value is 
    ignored when removing a service app, so the value entered here does not matter. 


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPBCSServiceApp BCSServiceApp
            {
                Name                 = "BCS Service Application"
                ApplicationPool      = "n/a"
                Ensure               = "Absent"
                PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
