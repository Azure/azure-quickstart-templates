# Description
    
    **Type:** Distributed
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is responsible for provisioning the search service application.
    The current version lets you specify the database name and server, as well as
    the application pool. If the application pool is changed the DSC resource will
    set it back as per what is set in the resource. The database name parameter is
    used as the prefix for all search databases (so you will end up with one for
    the admin database which matches the name, and then
    "_analyticsreportingstore", "_crawlstore" and "_linkstore" databases as well).
    
    The default value for the Ensure parameter is Present. When not specifying this
    parameter, the service application is provisioned.
    
    NOTE: The WindowsServiceAccount parameter is deprecated and no longer does
    anything. The functionality for changing this account has been moved to
    SPSearchServiceSettings.

.EXAMPLE
    This example creates a new search service app in the local farm


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPSearchServiceApp SearchServiceApp
            {
                Name                  = "Search Service Application"
                DatabaseName          = "SP_Search"
                ApplicationPool       = "SharePoint Service Applications"
                PsDscRunAsCredential  = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
    }


.EXAMPLE
    This example removes a search service app in the local farm. The ApplicationPool
    parameter is still required but is not actually used, so its value does not matter.


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPSearchServiceApp SearchServiceApp
            {
                Name                  = "Search Service Application"
                Ensure                = "Absent"
                ApplicationPool       = "n/a"
                PsDscRunAsCredential  = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
    }
