# Description
    
    **Type:** Distributed
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is used to manage the sharing security settings of a specific
    service application. There are a number of approaches to how this can be
    implemented. Firstly you can set permissions for the app administrators, or
    for the sharing permission by specifying the SecurityType attribute. These
    options correlate to the buttons seen in the ribbon on the "manage service
    applications" page in Central Administration after you select a specific
    service app. The "Members" property will set a specific list of members for
    the service app, making sure that every user/group in the list is in the group
    and all others that are members and who are not in this list will be removed.
    The "MembersToInclude" and "MembersToExclude" properties will allow you to
    control a specific set of users to add or remove, without changing any other
    members that are in the group already that may not be specified here, allowing
    
    NOTE:
    In order to specify Local Farm you can use the token "\{LocalFarm\}"
    as the username. The token is case sensitive.

.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how full control permission can be given to the farm
    account and service app pool account to the user profile service app's
    sharing permission.
    It also shows granting access to specific areas to a user.

    {
        param(

            [PSCredential]

    }


.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to use the local farm token to grant
    full control permission to the local farm to the
    user profile service app's sharing permission.


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            $members = @()
            $members += MSFT_SPServiceAppSecurityEntry {
                                    Username     = "{LocalFarm}"
                                    AccessLevels = @("Full Control")
                                }

                SecurityType         = "SharingPermissions"
                Members              = $members
                PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
            }
