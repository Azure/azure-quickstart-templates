# Description
    
    **Type:** Common
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is used to manage the membership of the farm administrators
    group. There are a number of approaches to how this can be implemented. The
    "members" property will set a specific list of members for the group, making
    sure that every user/group in the list is in the group and all others that are
    members and who are not in this list will be removed. The "MembersToInclude"
    and "MembersToExclude" properties will allow you to control a specific set of
    users to add or remove, without changing any other members that are in the
    group already that may not be specified here, allowing for some manual
    management outside of this configuration resource.

.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to set a specific list of members for the farm admins group.
    Any members not in this list will be removed.


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPFarmAdministrators LocalFarmAdmins
            {
                IsSingleInstance     = "Yes"
                Members              = @("CONTOSO\user1", "CONTOSO\user2")
                PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
    }


.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how certain changes are made to the farm admins groups. Here any
    members in the MembersToInclude property are added, and members in the MembersToExclude
    property are removed. Any members that exist in the farm admins group that aren't listed
    in either of these properties are left alone.


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPFarmAdministrators LocalFarmAdmins
            {
                IsSingleInstance     = "Yes"
                MembersToInclude     = @("CONTOSO\user1")
                MembersToExclude     = @("CONTOSO\user2")
                PsDscRunAsCredential = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
    }
