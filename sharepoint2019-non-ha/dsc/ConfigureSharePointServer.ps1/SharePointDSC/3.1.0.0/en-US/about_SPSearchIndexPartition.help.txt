    SPSearchIndexPartition

# Description
    
    **Type:** Distributed
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is responsible for creating search indexes. It works by creating
    the index topology components and updating the topology from the server that
    runs this resource. For this reason this resource only needs to run from one
    server and not from each server which will host the index component. The
    search service application and existing search topology must be deployed
    before creating additional indexes. The first index will be created through
    the use of the SPSearchRoles resource. Additional search index partitions can
    be created through using this resource.
    
    Note that for the search topology to apply correctly, the path specified for
    RootDirectory needs to exist on the server that is executing this resource. For
    example, if the below example was executed on "Server1" it would also need to
    ensure that it was able to create the index path at I:\. If no disk labeled I:
    was available on server1, this would fail, even though it will not hold an
    actual index component.
    
.PARAMETER Index
    Key - Uint32

.PARAMETER Servers
    Required - String
    A list of the servers that this partition should exist on

.PARAMETER RootDirectory
    Write - String
    The directory that the index should use locally on each server to store data

.PARAMETER ServiceAppName
    Key - String
    The name of the search service application

.PARAMETER InstallAccount
    Write - String
    POWERSHELL 4 ONLY: The account to run this resource as, use PsDscRunAsCredential if using PowerShell 5
