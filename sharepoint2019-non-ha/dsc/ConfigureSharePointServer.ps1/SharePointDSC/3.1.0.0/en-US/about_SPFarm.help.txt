    SPFarm

# Description
    
    **Type:** Specific
    **Requires CredSSP:** No
    
    This resource is used to create a new SharePoint farm and allow servers to
    join that farm. It will detect the presence of the configuration database
    on the SQL server as a first step, and if it does not exist then the farm
    will be created. If the database does exist, the server will join that
    configuration database. Once the config DB has been created, the
    resource will install local help collections, secure resources and activate
    features.
    
    If the central admin site is to be running on the local server, the
    RunCentralAdmin property should be set to true. In the event that the central
    admin site has not been provisioned, this resource will first create it,
    otherwise it will simply start the central admin service instance on the
    local server.
    
    The passphrase is passed as a Credential object.The username of this
    credential is ignored, only the value of the password is used as the farm
    passphrase.
    
    The port of the Central Admin website can be set by using the
    CentralAdministrationPort property, if this is not defined the site will be
    provisioned on port 9999. However this setting will not impact existing
    deployments that already have Central Admin provisioned on another port. Also
    when a farm is created, the current behavior is to not enroll the server as a
    cache server (which is the default behavior of SharePoint). This means you
    need to use SPDistributedCacheService on at least one server in the farm to
    designate it as a cache server.
    
    CentralAdministrationAuth can be specified as "NTLM" or "KERBEROS". If not
    specified, it defaults to NTLM. If using Kerberos, make sure to have
    appropriate SPNs setup for Farm account and Central Administration URI.

.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how a basic SharePoint farm can be created. The database server and names
    are specified, and the accounts to run the setup as, the farm account and the passphrase are
    all passed in to the configuration to be applied. By default the central admin site in this
    example is provisioned to port 9999 using NTLM authentication.

    example is provisioned to port 9999 using NTLM authentication. In this example we also see
    the server role defined as "Application" which tells SharePoint 2016/2019 the role to apply to
    this server as soon as the farm is created. This property is not supported for SharePoint 2013
    and so this specific example would fail if used against that verison.
