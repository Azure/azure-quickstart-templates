    This resource is responsible for controlling the blocked file type setting on a
    specific web application. It has two modes of operation, the first is to use
    the "blocked" property, where you are able to define a specific list of file
    types that will be blocked. In this mode when it is detected that the list
    does not match the local farm, it is set to match this list exactly. The
    second mode is to use the "EnsureBlocked" and "EnsureAllowed" properties.
    EnsureBlocked will check to make sure that the specified file types are on the
    list, and if not they will be added. EnsureAllowed checks to make sure that a
    file type is not on the list, and if it is it will be removed. Both of these
    properties will only make changes to the file types in their list and will
    leave the full list as it is otherwise, whereas the blocked property resets
    
.PARAMETER WebAppUrl
    Key - string
    The URL of the web application to set blocked file types for

.PARAMETER Blocked
    write - string
    This is a fixed list to use for blocked file types in this web app

.PARAMETER EnsureBlocked
    write - string
    This list of file types that will always be added to the list for this web app. Types not in this list will be left in the list

.PARAMETER EnsureAllowed
    write - string
    This list of file types that will always be removedfrom the list for this web app. Types not in this list will be left in the list

.PARAMETER InstallAccount
    Write - string
    POWERSHELL 4 ONLY: The account to run this resource as, use PsDscRunAsCredential if using PowerShell 5


.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to ensure that specific file types are always blocked while
    others will always be allowed. Any file types not mentioned in this config will be
    able to be managed manually.


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPWebAppBlockedFileTypes PrimaryWebAppBlockedFileTypes
            {
                WebAppUrl              = "http://exmaple.contoso.local"
                EnsureBlocked          = @("exe", "dll", "msi")
                EnsureAllowed          = @("pdf", "docx", "xlsx")
                PsDscRunAsCredential   = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
    }


.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to ensure that the blocked file type list always
    specifically matches this list.


    Configuration Example
    {
        param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
            [PSCredential]
            $SetupAccount
        )
        Import-DscResource -ModuleName SharePointDsc

        node localhost {
            SPWebAppBlockedFileTypes PrimaryWebAppBlockedFileTypes
            {
                WebAppUrl              = "http://exmaple.contoso.local"
                Blocked                = @("exe", "dll", "msi")
                PsDscRunAsCredential   = $SetupAccount
            }
        }
    }
