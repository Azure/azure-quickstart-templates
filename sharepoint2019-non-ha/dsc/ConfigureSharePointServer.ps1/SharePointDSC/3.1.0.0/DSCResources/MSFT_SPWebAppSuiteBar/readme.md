This resource is used to set the Suite Bar branding for web
applications. It supports both the SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint
2016/2019 ways of branding the suite bar.

Requirements:
For SharePoint 2013, only the SuiteBarBrandingElementHtml should
be specified, whereas for SharePoint 2016/2019, all properties
are supported. Note that SuiteBarBrandingElementHtml has no
effect unless using a SharePoint 2013 master page.
