## Solution overview

This template uses the PowerShell DSC extension to deploy a fully configured Always On Availability Group with SQL Server 2014 replicas.

This template creates the following resources:

+   1 Virtual Network
+   4 Azure storage accounts
    +    1 for domain controller virtual machines
    +    1 for SQL Server virtual machines
    +    1 for Failover Cluster File Share Witness
    +    1 for deployment diagnostics
+   1 internal load balancer
+   1 external load balancer
+   3 virtual machines in a Windows Server Cluster
    +    2 SQL Server 2014 Enterprise edition replicas with an availability group
    +    1 virtual machine is a File Share Witness for the Cluster
+   2 domain controller virtual machines replicas for a new Forest and Domain
+   2 Availability Sets
    +     1 for domain controller virtual machines
    +     1 for SQL Server and Witness virtual machines
+   1 public IP addresses for RDP access

## Notes

+ 	File Share Witness and SQL Server VMs are from the same Availability Set and currently there is a constrain for mixing DS-Series machine, DS_v2-Series machine and GS-Series machine into the same Availability Set. If you decide to have DS-Series SQL Server VMs you must also have a DS-Series File Share Witness; If you decide to have GS-Series SQL Server VMs you must also have a GS-Series File Share Witness; If you decide to have DS_v2-Series SQL Server VMs you must also have a DS_v2-Series File Share Witness.

+	The default settings for SQL Server storage are to deploy using **premium storage**, the AD witness uses a P10 Disk and the SQL VMs use P30 disks, these sizes can be changed by changing the relevant variables. In addition there is a P10 Disk used for each VMs OS Disk.

+ 	In default settings for compute require that you have at least 15 cores of free quota to deploy.

+ 	The images used to create this deployment are
	+ 	DC - Latest Windows Server 2012 R2 Image
	+ 	SQL Server - Latest SQL Server 2014 on Windows Server 2012 R2 Image or Latest SQL Server 2012SP1 on Windows Server 2012 R2 Image
	+ 	Witness - Latest Windows Server 2012 R2 Image

+ 	Once deployed access can be gained by the public IP address of Primary Domain Controller
