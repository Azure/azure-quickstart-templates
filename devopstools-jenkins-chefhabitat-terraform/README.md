## Solution Architecture:

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/msoss-p1/devopstools-jenkins-chefhabitat-terraform/images/1.png)

This solution will deploy the following architecture:

1. Virtual Network with four subnets:

- Subnet1 – Jenkins server, Build instance with Chef Habitat
- Subnet2 – VM scale set
- Subnet3 – Elastic Stack
- Subnet4 – MongoDB

1. Azure Load Balancer
2. Azure Storage Account
3. GitHub- The Terraform code is taken from GitHub and has been configured as a job in Jenkins.

## Terraform:

**Terraform** is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure.

Terraform&#39;s manageable infrastructure includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.

## Packer:

**Packer** is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. It is easy to use and automates the process of creating server images. It supports multiple provisioners, all built into Packer.

### Why Packer?

- Supports multiple platforms such as Azure, VMware, VirtualBox, and other cloud vendors.
- Easy to use and mostly automated.
- Supports Ansible as a provisioner.

## ELK Stack:

**Elastic** is the company behind Elastic stack, which is a suite of products including **E** lasticsearch, **L** ogstash and **K** ibana.  The ELK stack makes it easier and faster to search and analyze large data sets. Logstash is used to normalize the data, Elasticsearch processes, and then Kibana visualizes it.

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an open-source, broadly-distributable, readily-scalable, enterprise-grade search engine. Elasticsearch can power extremely fast searches that support your data discovery applications **.** Consider these benefits:

- **Real-time data and real-time analytics:** The ELK stack gives you the power of real-time data insights, with the ability to perform super-fast data extractions from virtually all structured or unstructured data sources. With real-time extraction and real-time analytics, Elasticsearch is the engine that gives you both power and speed.
- **Scalable, high-availability, multi-tenant:**   It is built to scale horizontally out of the box. As you need more capacity, simply add another node and let the cluster reorganize itself to accommodate and exploit the extra hardware. Elasticsearch clusters are resilient since they automatically detect and remove node failures. You can set up multiple indices and query each of them independently or in combination.
- **Full text search: ** Elasticsearch uses Lucene to provide the most powerful full-text search capabilities available in any open-source product. The search features come with multi-language support, an extensive query language, geolocation support, context-sensitive suggestions, and autocompletion.
- **Document orientation:**  You can store complex, real-world entities in Elasticsearch as structured JSON documents. All fields have a default index, and you can use all the indices in a single query to get precise results in the blink of an eye.

### Logstash—Routing Your Log Data

**Logstash** is a tool for log data intake, processing, and output. This includes virtually any type of log that you manage: system logs, webserver logs, error logs, and app logs.  You can save a lot of time by training Logstash to normalize the data, getting Elasticsearch to process the data, and then visualizing it with Kibana. With Logstash, it&#39;s easy to take all those logs and store them in a central location. The only prerequisite is a Java runtime, and it takes just two commands to get Logstash up and running. Logstash will serve as the workhorse for storage, querying, and analysis of your logs. Since it has an arsenal of ready-made inputs, filters, codecs, and outputs, you can grab hold of a very powerful feature-set with a very little effort on your part. Think of Logstash as a pipeline for event processing: it takes precious little time to choose the inputs, configure the filters, and extract the relevant, high-value data from your log.

### Kibana—Visualizing Your Log Data

**Kibana ** is your log-data dashboard. Get a better grip on your large data stores with point-and-click pie charts, bar graphs, trendlines, maps, and scatter plots. You can visualize trends and patterns for data that would otherwise be extremely tedious to read and interpret. Eventually, each business line can make practical use of your data collection as you help them customize their dashboards. Save it, share it, and link your data visualizations for quick and smart communication.

### Beats—Lightweight Data Shippers

**Beats** is the platform for single-purpose data shippers. They install as lightweight agents and send data from hundreds or thousands of machines to Logstash or Elasticsearch. ELK allows Filebeat, Packetbeat, Metricbeat and Winlogbeat to ship log data from client servers.

**Filebeat** : For Text log files.        
**Metricbeat** : For OS and application.
**Packetbeat** : For Network monitoring. 
**Winlogbeat** : For windows event logs.

**Flow Diagram:**

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/msoss-p1/devopstools-jenkins-chefhabitat-terraform/images/2.png)

### The following logs are visualized in Kibana:

| S.NO | Nodes            | Logs Path|
| ---- |-------------     | -------- |
| 1    | Application Node | /hab/svc/national-parks/logs/, /hab/pkgs/core/tomcat8/8.5.9/20170514144202/tc/logs/, /root/sup-national-parks.log|
| 2    | mongoDB          | /hab/svc/mongodb/logs, /hab/svc/mongodb/var/mongod.log, /root/sup.mongodb.log|

## Jenkins:

**Jenkins**  is an open-source, continuous integration software tool written in the Java programming language for testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time. This software enables developers to find and solve defects in a code base rapidly and automate testing of their builds. There are also hundreds of **plugins**  available to enhance its power and usability.

### Plugins:

The concept of plugins makes Jenkins attractive, easy to learn, and easy to use. Jenkins has many plugins available for free. These plugins help to integrate with various software tools for better convenience.

In this solution, we are using the Packer and Terraform plugins.

### Terraform plugin

Terraform works as a &quot;build wrapper&quot; and can be invoked by selecting Terraform under the Build Environment section of your job configuration.

Here, we are using Terraform plugin to deploy and configure ELK, MongoDB, and App nodes which are configured as a job in Jenkins.

This plugin provides an auto-installer to install the Terraform binary from  [bintray.com](http://bintray.com/).

### Packer plugin:

This plugin allows for a job to publish an image generated from [Packer](http://packer.io/).

At this level, this plugin can either use a global system-wide template for the chosen installation or packer template as text for a file.  As they are available at the system level,  [variables](http://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html) and temporary files can be configured and referenced in the template.

The plugin will automatically install the desired version of Packer on the node.

### Jenkins Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating _continuous delivery pipelines_ into Jenkins.

A _continuous delivery pipeline_ is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control through to users and customers. Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes through a complex process on its way to being released. This process involves building the software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as the progression of the built software (called a &quot;build&quot;) through multiple stages of testing and deployment. The Jenkins Pipeline automates large chunks of this process, making it easier to get vital changes to your users in a timely manner.

## Azure Storage Account:

**Microsoft Azure Storage** is a Microsoft-managed cloud service that provides storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. Microsoft takes care of maintenance and handles critical problems for you.

Azure Storage consists of three data services: Blob storage, File storage, and Queue storage. Blob storage supports both standard and premium storage, with premium storage using only SSDs for the fastest performance possible.

Another feature is cool storage, allowing you to store large amounts of rarely accessed data for a lower cost. Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS.

To use any of the services provided by Azure Storage -- Blob storage, File storage, and Queue storage -- you must first create a storage account, then you transfer data to/from a specific service in that storage account.

Here we are using an Azure Storage Account to store Packer image.

## Chef Habitat:

**Chef Habitat** is a new open source project that allows developers to package their applications and run them on a wide variety of infrastructures.

Habitat essentially wraps applications into their own lightweight runtime environments and then allows you to run them in any environment, including bare metal servers, virtual machines, Docker containers (and their respective container management services), and PaaS systems like Cloud Foundry.

### Why Habitat?

Habitat is a modern technology to build, deploy, and manage applications in any environment from traditional datacenters to containerized microservices.

This is because in Habitat, the application is the unit of automation.  This means the application package contains everything needed to deploy, run, and maintain the application.

### Packaging an Application with Habitat:

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/msoss-p1/devopstools-jenkins-chefhabitat-terraform/images/3.png)

### Habitat Components:

**Habitat Supervisor:**

Habitat Supervisor is what runs the application artifact. The Supervisor is what allows you to run the artifact natively on hardware, in a virtual machine, or in a container (in the case of a container, you can also run it through a container orchestration service like Kubernetes, Mesosphere, or Docker Swarm).

**Service Group:**

A service group is a logical grouping of services with the same package and topology type connected in a ring. They are created to share configuration and file updates among the services within those groups and can be segmented based on workflow or deployment needs (QA, Production, and so on).

### Habitat Packaging Format:

Habitat packages are in a format called the HART format, which stands for Habitat Artifact.

These HART packages contain the compiled application itself – if, for example, you had a Java application you were automating, you would have the compiled Java application within this package. Along with the application, these packages also include everything needed to deploy and run the application, all in one place.

### Habitat Highlights:

Habitat is a first of its kind open source project that offers an entirely new approach to application management. Habitat makes the application and its automation the unit of deployment. When applications are wrapped in a lightweight &quot;habitat,&quot; the runtime environment, whether it is a container, bare metal, or PaaS, is no longer the focus and does not constrain the application. Features of Habitat include:

- Support for the Modern Applications
- Run Any Application, Anywhere
- Easily Port Legacy Applications
- Improve the Container Experience
- Integrate into Chef&#39;s DevOps Workflow

## Prerequisites:

1. Generate your SSH key
2. Create service principal

### Generate your SSH key:

PuTTYgen is a key generator tool for creating SSH keys for PuTTY

1. PuTTYgen is normally installed as part of the normal PuTTY .msi package installation. There is no need for a separate PuTTYgen download. Download PuTTY from the  [**PuTTY download page**](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

2. Go to Windows  **Start menu**  →  **All Programs**  →  **PuTTY** →  **PuTTYgen** to generate an SSH key.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/msoss-p1/devopstools-jenkins-chefhabitat-terraform/images/4.png)

3. Click  **Generate** , and start moving the mouse within the window. Putty uses mouse movements to collect randomness. You may need to move the mouse for some time, depending on the size of your key. As you move it, the green progress bar should advance.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/msoss-p1/devopstools-jenkins-chefhabitat-terraform/images/5.png)

4. Once the progress bar becomes full, the actual key generation computation takes place. When complete, the public key should appear in the Window.

5. Copy the Public Key in a notepad. This will be used while deploying the ARM Template.

6. You should save at the private key by clicking  **Save private key** , this private key will be used to log in to the Jenkins server.

![alt text](https://github.com/sysgain/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/msoss-p1/devopstools-jenkins-chefhabitat-terraform/images/6.png)

### Create Service principal

To deploy the ARM template, you need to create a service principal to deploy the Terraform code which is configured as an ELK job in Jenkins.

You can create a service principal within the Azure Portal via Azure Cloud Shell. The AD identity running this installation should have the  **Owner**  role on the required Subscription.

1. We need to create a Service Principal to pass in to the template properties. If you do not have an existing Service Principal, you can create one using the  **following**  command:

    **az ad sp create-for-rbac**

You will receive the following output:

        Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36_

            {

              appId:ABCDEFGH-YOUR-GUID-HERE-IJKLMNOP

              displayName: azure-cli-2017-05-23-15-28-34

              name: http://azure-cli-2017-05-23-15-28-34

              password:an autogenerated password will appear here

              tenant:ABCDEFGH-YOUR-GUID-HERE-IJKLMNOP

            }

2. Note the values for  **appId** , **password(ClientSecret)** for the parameters section.
