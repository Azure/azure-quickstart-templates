  "itemDisplayName": "Create VM from a custom image in new storage account",
  "description": "This template allows you to create a new Virtual Machine from a custom image on a new storage account deployed together with the storage account, which means the source image VHD must be transferred to the newly created storage account before that Virtual Machine is deployed. This is accomplished by the usage of a transfer virtual machine that is deployed and then uses a script via custom script extension to copy the source VHD to the destination storage account.",
