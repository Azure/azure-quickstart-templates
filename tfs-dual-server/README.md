This template creates a TFS deployment with three VMs. One VM serves as a domain controller for the other two. One of the domain-joined VMs will run SQL Server Standard edition. The second will run TFS, configured to use SQL on the first. All three will support RDP through NAT rules on a load balancer. This template is meant to be used to evaluate TFS in Azure, not as a production deployment.

## After Deployment

All three VMs are behind a public-facing load balancer with NAT rules enabling RDP. To access TFS you can RDP into any of the VMs using the IP address on the load balancer, and the username & password provided during the deployment. TFS will be available on port 8080 (e.g. http://vmName:8080/tfs)
