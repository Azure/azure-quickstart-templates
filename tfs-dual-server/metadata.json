  "description": "This template creates a TFS deployment with three VMs. One VM serves as a domain controller for the other two. One of the domain-joined VMs will run SQL Server Standard edition. The second will run TFS, configured to use SQL on the first. All three will support RDP through NAT rules on a load balancer. This template is meant to be used to evaluate TFS in Azure, not as a production deployment.",
  "summary": "This template creates a TFS deployment with three VMs - a domain controller, a TFS application tier, and a SQL Server data tier.",
