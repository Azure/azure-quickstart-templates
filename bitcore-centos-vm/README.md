This template uses the Azure Linux CustomScript extension to deploy a Bitcore Node instance with the complete set of Bitcore utilities. Please note that you will need at least 150GB of disk space in order to host the entire Bitcoin Blockchain as well as Bitcore indexes. The deployment template creates a CentOS VM, installs Bitcore and provides a simple bitcored executable. Go to ../demo.html to see the deployed page.
