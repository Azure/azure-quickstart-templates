The Template deploys API Management service Standard Tier with integration with Managed Identities. Please refer to documentation at aka.ms/apimmsi.

The template shows how to create an API Management with SSL retrieved from KeyVault using a single click deployment using User Assigned identities.

With System Assigned identity, associating an API Management with SSL was a two step process. With User Assigned identities, this is single step.

It deploys the following components
- User Assigned Managed Identity
- KeyVault which is granted access to the Managed Identity
- API Management service which is assigned access to the KeyVault using User Assigned Identity.
