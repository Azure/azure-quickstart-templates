# Ubuntu Server 18.04-LTS Virtual Machine

The purpose of this ARM Template is **simple Ubuntu Server Virtual Machine** inserting a few parameters.

## The Template

Don't let the size of the template scares you. The structure is very intuitive and once that you get the gist of it, you will see how easier your life will be regarding deploying resources to Azure.

Those are the parameters on the template, most of them are already with the values, the ones that you need to inform are: **adminUsername**, **adminPassword** and **resourceGroup**. All the other parameters will be already informed.

Don't worry about changing anything on the file, either on the portal or using Azure CLI, you need to inform just the following parameters.

- *adminUsername:* Usernames can be a maximum of 20 characters and cannot end in a period (".").

- *adminPassword:* Password requirements between 12 to 72 characters and have lower and upper characters, a digit and a special character (Regex match [\W_])

- *resourceGroup:* The Resource Group that will have your deployment. We go in detail in the next section.

Let's rock with the Deployment.  

## Deployment

There are a few ways to deploy your template.
You can use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-cli), [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal) or your favorite SDK.

For this task, we going to deploy using Visual Code and the portal and a little surprise for you at the end. :D

For Azure CLI I choose to use the Visual Code with Azure CLI extensions, if you like, you can find more information [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/extensions). But bare in mind that you don't need to use the Visual Code, you can stick with the old good always present **Command Line** on Windows or any **bash terminal**.

### Using Azure CLI with Visual Code

type on the terminal window: **az login**

![Screen](./images/azlogin.png)

You will be redirected to the Azure Portal where you can insert your credentials and log in.

After logged in, you will see your credentials on the terminal.

To set the right subscription, type following command:

#### az account set --subscription "your subscription id"

### Resource Group

Now you need a Resource Group for our deployment. If you haven't yet created a Resource Group, you can do it now. If you are new on Azure and wonder what is a Resource Group? Bare with me! A Resource Group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. Simply saying, it's like a folder that contains files. Simple as that.

To create a Resource Group, you need a name and a location for your Resource Group.

For a list of locations, type: **az account list-locations**

To create the Resource group, type the command:

#### az group create --name "resource-group" --location "your location"

![Screen](./images/azgroup.png)

Super simple, right? Now that you have your **Resource Group** created, let's deploy the Virtual Machine.

#### az group deployment create --name "name of your deployment" --resource-group "resource-group" --template-file "./azuredeploy.json"

![Screen](./images/azdeploy.png)

As you can see, it's running. Go grab a cup of coffee, have some fresh air and I'm sure that before you come back you will have your Virtual Machine ready.

And there we go, the deployment is succeeded:

Let's go and check the resource at the Azure Portal:
Go the Resource Group, find the Resource group you've created.
And there it's your brand new **Virtual Machine**:

Open your Virtual Machine and then click on the button **connect**.

Where you have **Login using VM Local account** copy the ssh command and open your terminal.

Paste the command and press **Enter**.  

Insert the password you've created.

And Voilà, there you have a brandy new Ubuntu Virtual Machine.

Have fun!

Once the VM is successfully provisioned, tomcat installation can be verified by accessing the link http://<FQDN name or public IP>:8080/  

### Using the Portal

At the Portal, in All Services look for **Templates**, you can favorite this service.

Click in **Add** to add your template:

![Screen](./images/azportal.png)

On General, type a name and a description for your template, and click on [OK].

![Screen](./images/aztemplate.png)

On ARM Template, replace the contents of the template with your template, and click on [OK].

![Screen](./images/aztemplate2.png)

Click on the refresh button and there is your template:

![Screen](./images/aztemplate3.png)

Open the template and click in [Deploy]

On the screen Custom Deployment, insert the information that you must be already familiar with.

Select [I agree] and click on [Purchase].

![Screen](./images/azportaldepoy3.png)

And voilà, you have your new VM deployed.

To connect with the Virtual Machine you can repeat the same process as before, connecting through the terminal.

Now is time to get your hands dirty, don't forget that you are in the cloud :D

Once the VM is successfully provisioned, tomcat installation can be verified by accessing the link http://<FQDN name or public IP>:8080/  

**p.s.: Pretty easy to create resources on Azure, right? But if you are the sort of IT guy that always loves automation, here is the surprise. Just click on the button below and it will automatically deploy the VM through the  Azure Portal.**

#### Important disclaimer: Azure charges you for the resources you are using, and you don't want to finish all your credits immediately, right? So, for not running out of credit, don't forget to stop the VM at the portal or even delete the Resource Group you create to avoid any unnecessary charges

### How to shutdown your resources

#### Using the portal

On the portal, open your Resource Group, if you will not use the service or VM anymore, you can just click on the [Delete] Button.

![Screen](./images/off1.png)

You can also just stop the service or the Virtual Machine in case you need the resource. Open the resource and click on Stop.

![Screen](./images/off2.png)

Just refresh your screen and you are good to go.
