## Subscriptions and Costs 

This ARM template uses an Azure CentOS 8 image which is a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) VM image and does not require the user to license. The VM will be licensed automatically after the instance is launched for the first time and the user will be charged hourly in addition to Microsoft's Linux VM rates. [Linux Virtual Machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/#linux) provides pricing details. WildFly is free to download and use and does not require a Red Hat Subscription or License.

## Prerequisites 

1. Azure Subscription with specified payment method. CentOS-Based 8.0 is an Azure Marketplace product and requires a payment method to be specified in the Azure Subscription.

2. To create the VM, you will need:

    - **Admin Username** and password or SSH key data which is an SSH RSA public key for the VM.

    - **WildFly Username** and password to enable the WildFly Admin Console and Deployment method.

## Deployment Steps  

Build your environment with WildFly 18.0.1.Final on a VM by running CentOS 8.0 on Azure in a few simple steps:  
1. Launch the template by clicking on the **Deploy to Azure** button.  
2. Complete the following parameter values, accept the Terms and Conditions and click on the **Purchase** button.

    - **Subscription** - Choose the appropriate subscription for deployment.

    - **Resource Group** - Create a new Resource Group or select an existing one.

    - **Location** - Choose the appropriate location for deployment.

    - **Admin Username** - User account name for logging into the CentOS VM.

    - **Authentication Type** - Type of authentication to use on the VM (password or SSH key).

    - **Admin Password or SSH key** - User account password or SSH key data which is an SSH RSA public key for logging into the CentOS VM.

    - **WildFly Username** - Username for WildFly Admin Console Manager.

    - **WildFly Password** - User account password for WildFly Admin Console Manager.

    - **VM Size** - Select the appropriate size of the VM from the dropdown options.

    - Leave the rest of the parameter values (Artifacts and Location) as is, accept the Terms & Conditions and proceed to purchase.

## Deployment Time 

The deployment takes less than 10 minutes to complete.

## Validation Steps

Once the deployment is successful, go to the outputs section of the deployment to obtain the **Private IP of the CentOS VM**, **app URL** and the **Admin Console URL**. You can access the CentOS VM and the application by following one of the 5 options:

1. Create a Public IP to access the CentOS VM and WildFly Admin Console.
2. Create a Jump VM in a different subnet (new subnet) in the same Virtual Network and access the CentOS VM via a Jump VM. 
3. Create a Jump VM in a different Virtual Network and access the CentOS VM using Virtual Network Peering. (recommended method)
4. Using an Application Gateway.
5. Using an External Load Balancer (ELB).

**Option 1 of 5**. Create Public IP to access the CentOS VM and WildFly Admin Console

   - The CentOS VM you created does not have a Public IP associated with it. You can [create a Public IP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-public-ip-address#create-a-public-ip-address) for accessing the VM and [associate the Public IP to the VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/associate-public-ip-address-vm). All this can be done using Azure Portal or Powershell commands or CLI commands.

   - Obtain the Public IP of a VM - go to the VM details page and copy the Public IP. You can use this Public IP to access the VM and WildFly Admin Console.

   - View the JBoss EAP on Azure web page - open a web browser and go to *http://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>:8080/JBoss-EAP_on_Azure/* and you should see the application running.

     <a href="mailto:appdevonazure@redhat.com">
       <img src="images/app.png"/>
     </a>

   - Log into the WildFly Admin Console - open a web browser and go to *http://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>:9990*. Enter the WildFly username and password to login.

**Option 2 of 5**. Create a Jump VM in a different subnet (new subnet) in the same Virtual Network and access the CentOS VM via Jump VM.

   - [Add a new subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet#add-a-subnet) in the existing Virtual Network which contains the CentOS VM.

   - [Create a Windows Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal#create-virtual-machine) in Azure in the same Resource Group as the CentOS VM. Provide the required details and leave other configurations as default except for the Virtual Network and subnet. Make sure you select the existing Virtual Network in the Resource Group and select the subnet you just created in the step above. This will be your Jump VM.

   - Access Jump VM Public IP - once successfully deployed, go to the VM details page and copy the Public IP. Log into the Jump VM using this Public IP.

   - Log into CentOS VM - copy the Private IP of CentOS VM from the output page and use it to log into the CentOS VM from the Jump VM.

   - Access the JBoss EAP on Azure web page - in your Jump VM, open a browser and paste the app URL that you copied from the output page of the deployment.

     <a href="mailto:appdevonazure@redhat.com">
       <img src="images/app.png"/>
     </a>
     
   - Access the WildFly Admin Console - paste the Admin Console URL that you copied from the output page in a browser inside the Jump VM to access the WildFly Admin Console and enter the WildFly username and password to login.

     ![alt text](images/wildfly-console.png)

**Option 3 of 5**. Create a Jump VM in a different Virtual Network and access the CentOS VM using Virtual Network Peering.

   - [Create a Windows Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal#create-virtual-machine) - in a new Azure Resource Group, create a Windows VM. This should be in the same location as CentOS VM. Provide the required details and leave other configurations as default. This will create the Jump VM in a new Virtual Network.

   - [Peer the Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks-portal#peer-virtual-networks) - this is how you associate the CentOS VM with the Jump VM. Once the Virtual Network peering is successful, both the VMs can communicate with each other.

   - Go to the Jump VM details page and copy the Public IP. Log into the Jump VM using this Public IP.

   - Copy the Private IP of CentOS VM from the output page and use it to log into the CentOS VM from the Jump VM.

   - Paste the app URL that you copied from the output page in a browser inside the Jump VM to view the JBoss EAP on Azure web page.

     <a href="mailto:appdevonazure@redhat.com">
       <img src="images/app.png"/>
     </a>
     
   - Access the WildFly Admin Console - paste the Admin Console URL copied from the output page in a browser inside the Jump VM, enter the WilldFly username and password to login.

     ![alt text](images/wildfly-console.png)

**Option 4 of 5**. Using an Application Gateway

   - [Create an Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/quick-create-portal#create-an-application-gateway) - to access the ports of the CentOS VM, create an Application Gateway in a different subnet. This subnet must only contain the Application Gateway.

   - Set *Frontends* parameters - make sure you select Public IP or both and provide the required details. Under *Backends* section, select **Add a backend pool** option and add the CentOS VM to the backend pool of the Application Gateway.

   - Set access ports - under *Configuration* section add routing rules to access the ports 8080 and 9990 of the CentOS VM.

   - Copy Public IP of Application Gateway - once the Application Gateway is created with the required configurations, go to the  overview page and copy the Public IP of the Application Gateway.

   - To view the JBoss EAP on Azure web page - open a web browser and go to *http://<PUBLIC_IP_AppGateway>:8080/JBoss-EAP_on_Azure/* and you should see the application running.

     <a href="mailto:appdevonazure@redhat.com">
       <img src="images/app.png"/>
     </a>

   - To log into the WildFly Admin Console - open a web browser and go to *http://<PUBLIC_IP_AppGateway>:9990*. Enter the WildFly username and password to login.

     ![alt text](images/wildfly-console.png)

**Option 5 of 5**. Using an External Load Balancer.

   - [Create a Load Balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-standard-manage-portal#create-a-standard-load-balancer) to access the ports of the CentOS VM. Provide the required details to deploy the external Load Balancer and leave other configurations as default. Leave the SKU as Basic for this configuration.

   - Add Load Balancer rules - once the Load balancer has been created successfully, [create Load Balancer resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/tutorial-load-balancer-standard-manage-portal#create-load-balancer-resources), add Load Balancer rules to access the ports 8080 and 9990 of the CentOS VM.

   - Add the CentOS VM to the backend pool of the Load Balancer - click on *Backend pools* under settings section and then select the backend pool you created in the step above. Select the Virtual Machine corresponding to the option *Associated to* and then add the CentOS VM.

   - To obtain the Public IP of the Load Balancer - go to the Load Balancer overview page and copy the Public IP of the Load Balancer.

   - To view the JBoss EAP on Azure web page - open a web browser and go to *http://<PUBLIC_IP_LoadBalancer>:8080/JBoss-EAP_on_Azure/* and you should see the application running.

     <a href="mailto:appdevonazure@redhat.com">
       <img src="images/app.png"/>
     </a>

   - To log into the WildFly Admin Console - open a web browser and go to *http://<PUBLIC_IP_LoadBalancer>:9990*. Enter the WildFly username and password to login.
