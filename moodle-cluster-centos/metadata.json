  "itemDisplayName": "Deploy Moodle cluster on Centos",
  "description": "This template deploys Moodle as a LAMP application on Centos. It creates a one or more Centos VM for the front end and a single VM for the backend. It does a silent install of Apache and PHP on the front end VM's and MySQL on the backend VM. Then it deploys Moodle on the cluster. It configures a load balancer for directing requests to the front end VM's. It also configures NAT rules to allow admin access to each of the VM's. It also sets up a moodledata data directory using file storage shared among the VM's. It then installs the selected version of Moodle on all the front end VM's. If specified, it also installs the corresponding version of the  Microsoft Office 365 plugins for Moodle. After the deployment is successful, you can go to /moodle to start configuring Moodle.",
