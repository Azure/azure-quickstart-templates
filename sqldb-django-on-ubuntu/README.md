This template uses the Azure Linux CustomScript extension to deploy a Django application by creating an Ubuntu VM, doing a silent install of Python and Apache, then creating a simple Django application. The template also creates a SQL Database, with a sample table with some sample data which is displayed in the web browser using a query

Once the template is deployed, just grab the FQDN of the VM and open it in a browser and you'll see the sample data displayed on your screen. Make sure you wait 10-15 minutes after the template is deployed before you access the DNS name. There might be a lag when accessing the dns in your browser. Please refresh your browser a few times to mitigate it.
