  "description": "This template creates a new System Center Configuration Manager Technical Preview Lab environment. It creates 3 new Azure VMs, configuring a new AD Domain Controller for a new Domain, SQL Server for site database, a standalone primary site and a remote site system server with Management Point and Distribution Point roles. The VM size used in these templates are B series (B2s and B2ms). They use premium disks which would incur costs even when they are off. However you can change the disk configuration of VM in Azure portal. Note: This ConfigMgr/SCCM template is to be used for Lab purpose only.",
