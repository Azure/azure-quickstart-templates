To deploy this template using the scripts from the root of this repo: 

```PowerShell
.\Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.ps1 -ResourceGroupLocation 'eastus' -ArtifactsStagingDirectory 'tableau-server-windows-1node' -UploadArtifacts 
```
```bash
azure-group-deploy.sh -a tableau-server-windows-1node -l eastus -u
```

This template has artifacts that need to be "staged" for deployment (Configuration Scripts, Nested Templates, DSC Packages) so you have to set the upload switch on the command.
You can optionally specify a storage account to use, if so the storage account must already exist within the subscription.  If you don't want to specify a storage account
one will be created by the script (think of this as "temp" storage for AzureRM) and reused by subsequent deployments.

This template deploys a **single node Tableau Server instance on a Windows, Standard_D16_v3 VM instance** in its own Virtual Network.

## Solution overview and deployed resources

Tableau Server on Azure is browser and mobile-base visual analytics anyone can use.  Publish interactive dashboards with Tableau Desktop and share them throughout your organization.

Tableau is designed to make connecting live to data of all types a simple process that doesn't require any coding or scripting. From cloud sources like Azure SQL Data Warehouse, to on-premise Hadoop clusters, to local spreadsheets, Tableau gives everyone the power to quickly start visually exploring data of any size to find new insights.
