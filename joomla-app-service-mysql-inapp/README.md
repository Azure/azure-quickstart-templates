# Deploy Joomla Web App with MySQL in App
The template will deploy an [App service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/) Web App (Windows) in a new or existing App Service Plan with [MySQL in App](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/MySQL-in-app/) enabled.<br>
If you want to deploy in existing App Service Plan instead of a new one, just type the name of your existing App Service Plan and match the SKU<br>
The template will also pull all the necessary Joomla files into the root directory. Note that pulling those files from the source repository might take up to 30 minutes.
