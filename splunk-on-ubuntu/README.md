# Install Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu VM using custom Script Linux Extension

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frarsan%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fsplunk-on-ubuntu%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">

This template deploys Splunk Enterprise on Azure as either **standalone** instance or a 3-node **cluster**. Each instance has eight (8) 1-TB data drives in RAID0 configuration. The template also provisions a storage account, a virtual network with subnets, public IP address, and all network interfaces & security groups required.

Once the deployment is complete, Splunk Enterprise can be accessed using the configured DNS address. The DNS address will include the `domainName` and `location` entered as parameters in the format `{domainName}.{location}.cloudapp.azure.com`. If you created a deployment with the dnsName parameter set to "splunk" in the West US region you could access Splunk Enterprise VM at `https://splunk.westus.cloudapp.azure.com`.

NOTE: The template uses Splunk's default certificates to enable HTTPS which will create a browser warning. Please follow instructions in Splunk Docs to secure Splunk Web [with your own SSL certificates](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/SecureSplunkWebusingasignedcertificate)


### Standalone Mode:
The instance has the following ports open:
* 22 for SSH
* 443 and 8000 for HTTPS & HTTP
* 9997 for TCP receiver traffic
* 8089 for Splunkd Management open to VNet

### Cluster Mode:
Cluster search head & cluster master have the following ports open:
* 22 for SSH
* 443 and 8000 for HTTPS & HTTP
* 8089 for Splunkd Management open to VNet

Cluster peer nodes have the following ports open:
* 22 for SSH
* 9997 for TCP receiver traffic
* 9887 for TCP replication traffic
* 8089 for Splunkd Management open to VNet

##Known issues and limitations

- The template sets up SSH access via admin username/password, and would ideally use an SSH key.
- The template opens SSH port to the public. You can restrict it to a virtual network and/or a bastion host only.
