## What is BigchainDB?

BigchainDB has built the core characteristics of blockchains—decentralized control, immutability and the creation and transfer of assets—on top of a mature distributed database that has a rich feature set, monitoring and backup tools.

BigchainDB allows developers and enterprise to deploy blockchain proof-of-concepts, platforms and applications with a scalable blockchain database. BigchainDB supports a wide range of industries and use cases from identity and intellectual property to supply chains, energy, IoT and financial ecosystems. With high throughput, sub-second latency and powerful functionality to automate business processes, BigchainDB looks, acts and feels like a database but has the blockchain characteristics that enterprises want.
