**Blockchain Technology**
A blockchain is essentially a shared, encrypted ledger that cannot be manipulated, offering promise for secure transactions that allow anyone to get an accurate accounting of money, property or other assets.

**Develop Once, Deploy Cross-Platform**
Our Vision of the Future Transfers Gameunits from Game to Game + (Windows Mac Linux Desktop Phone & Xbox One Playstation and Wii)
Gaming has had a huge impact on the way we live our lives.
Remember what we do today can improve all our tomorrows!

**There are no chargebacks**
Once Gameunits have been sent, they’re gone. A person who has sent Gameunits cannot try to retrieve them without the recipient’s consent. This makes it difficult to commit the kind of fraud that we often see with credit cards.

**Proof of stake Technology**
PoS happens by a miner putting up a stake, or locking up an amount of their Gameunits, to verify a block of transactions.
The cryptographic calculations in PoS are much simpler for computers to solve: you only need to prove you own a certain percentage of Gameunits.
