# Bitcoin Core Blockchain Node on Ubuntu VM

This template delivers the Bitcoin network to your VM in about 15 minutes. Everything you need to get started using the Bitcoin blockchain from the command line is included. Once installed, 'bitcoind' will begin syncing the public blockchain. You may then connect via SSH to the VM and launch 'bitcoind' to interface with the blockchain.

# What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately usable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).
