# Sequence Blockchain Node on Ubuntu VM

This template delivers the Sequence network to your VM in about 15 minutes. Everything you need to get started using the Sequence blockchain from the command line is included. Once installed, 'sequenced' will begin syncing the public blockchain. You may then connect via SSH to the VM and launch 'sequenced' to interface with the blockchain.

[Sequence(SEQ)](https://duality.solutions/sequence) was developed to provide data redundancy for the BDAP protocol and support the applications created by Duality & third-party developers. Sequence nodes implement static Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards in exchange for supporting  the BDAP protocol, applications, blockchain and network.

[Sequence(SEQ)](https://duality.solutions/sequence) is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. [Sequence(SEQ)](https://duality.solutions/sequence) uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority (decentralisation): managing transactions and issuing currency [(SEQ)](https://duality.solutions/sequence) are carried out collectively by the [Sequence](https://duality.solutions/sequence) network. [Sequence](https://duality.solutions/sequence) is the name of open source software which enables the use of the currency [SEQ](https://duality.solutions/sequence).
