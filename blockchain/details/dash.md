# Dash Core Blockchain Node on Ubuntu VM

This template delivers the Dash network to your VM in about 15 minutes. Everything you need to get started using the Dash blockchain from the command line is included. Once installed, 'dashd' will begin syncing the public blockchain. You may then connect via SSH to the VM and launch 'dashd' to interface with the blockchain.

# What is Dash?

Dash is an experimental digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Dash uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Dash Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Dash Core software, see https://www.dash.org/get-dash/.
