  "description": "This template will deploy will deploy an Azure IoT Hub, Storage Account, Service Bus, Logic App and Web ApplicationThe Iot Hub will be used to manage the different IoT devices. It will also be built with a Service Bus included as one of the messaging routes. The Service Bus will be used to receive and handle messages from the IoT Device. The Storage Account will be used to save the messages in an Azure table. (Important Note: The ARM template does not create the actual stroage table for you, only the account. In the steps below you can find how to create a table that will work with the resources created by the ARM template) The Logic App will be used to read the messages from the Service Bus and then push them to the appropriate Azure Table. The Web Application will pull the messages from the Azure Table and display them in an HTML table. (The code for the web application is a part of this repo. So if you would like to edit the web application, feel free to fork and point your web app to the forked repo) ",
