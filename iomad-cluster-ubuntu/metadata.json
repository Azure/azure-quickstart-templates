  "itemDisplayName": "Deploy IOMAD cluster on Ubuntu",
  "description": "This template deploys IOMAD as a LAMP application on Ubuntu. It creates a one or more Ubuntu VM for the front end and a single VM for the backend. It does a silent install of Apache and PHP on the front end VM's and MySQL on the backend VM. Then it deploys IOMAD on the cluster. It configures a load balancer for directing requests to the front end VM's. It also configures NAT rules to allow admin access to each of the VM's. It also sets up a moodledata data directory using file storage shared among the VM's. After the deployment is successful, you can go to /iomad on each frontend VM (using web admin access) to start configuring IOMAD.",
