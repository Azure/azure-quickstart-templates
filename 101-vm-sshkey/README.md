This template allows you to create a Linux Virtual Machine with SSH Keys. This template also deploys a Storage Account, Virtual Network with an inbound rule allowing only port 22 connections, Public IP addresses, a Public domain namespace, and a Network Interface.

NOTE: The SSH rsa public key is typically generated by ssh-keygen, among other tools, on Linux, Mac, or Windows. If you already have an ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file, that will work directly, as you would expect. When deployed using the Preview Portal, you should paste in the contents of your ssh-rsa public key file as a string. 

When you deploy the template from the Azure CLI, when the parameter prompts you for the string, do not surround it in quotes, or they will be treated as part of the public key.
