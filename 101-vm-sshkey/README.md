This template allows you to create a Linux Virtual Machine with SSH Keys. This template also deploys a Storage Account, Virtual Network, Public IP addresses, a Public domain namespace, and a Network Interface.

NOTE: The SSH rsa public key is typically generated by ssh-keygen, among other tools, on Linux, Mac, or Windows. If you already have an ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file, that will work directly, as you would expect.
