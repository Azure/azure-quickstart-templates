  "description": "Azure Container Service preview (AKS) is the quickest path from zero to Kubernetes on Azure. This new service features an Azure-hosted control plane, automated upgrades, self-healing, easy scaling, and a simple user experience for both developers and cluster operators. With AKS, customers get the benefits of open source Kubernetes without complexity and operational overhead.\nTo help you get started with AKS, the managed Kubernetes service is free. With AKS you only pay for your Kubernetes nodes. This means on Azure, you will pay nothing for the management of your Kubernetes cluster, ever.\nAKS is currently available for Standard A, D, DS, G, GS, F, and FS series Linux virtual machines. You are only charged for the compute instances you choose, as well as the other underlying infrastructure resources consumed such as storage and networking. There are no incremental charges for AKS itself.\nDeployments typically takes a few minutes. Once complete, you can access and manage your cluster through \"az aks\" and \"kubectl\".",
