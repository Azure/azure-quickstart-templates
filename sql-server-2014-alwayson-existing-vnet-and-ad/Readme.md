# Create a SQL Server 2014 Always On Availability Group in an existing Azure VNET and an existing Active Directory instance

This template will create a SQL Server 2014 Always On Availability Group using the PowerShell DSC Extension in an existing Azure Virtual Network and Active Directory environment.

This template creates the following resources:

+	Three Storage Accounts
+	One internal load balancer
+	Three VMs in a Windows Server Cluster, two VMs run SQL Server 2014 with an availability group and the third is a File Share Witness for the Cluster
+	One Availability Set for the SQL and Witness VMs, configured with three Update Domains and three Fault Domains

A SQL Server always on listener is created using the internal load balancer.

For nested templates and DSC resources specific to SQL Server AlwaysOn, this template references these resources from this <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sql-server-2014-alwayson-dsc">SQL Server AlwaysOn AG QuickStart</a> template repository.

# Known Issues

This template is serial in nature for deploying some of the resources, due to some issues between the platform agent and the DSC extension which cause problems when multiple VM and\or extension resources are deployed concurrently.

## Notes

+	The default settings for storage are to deploy using **premium storage**.  The SQL VMs use two P30 disks each (for data and log).  These sizes can be changed by changing the relevant variables. In addition there is a P10 Disk used for each VM OS Disk.

+ 	The default settings for compute require that you have at least 9 cores of free quota to deploy.

+ 	The images used to create this deployment are
	+ 	SQL Server - Latest SQL Server 2014 on Windows Server 2012 R2 Image
	+ 	Witness - Latest Windows Server 2012 R2 Image

+ 	The image configuration is defined in variables - details below - but the scripts that configure this deployment have only been tested with these versions and may not work on other images.

+	To successfully deploy this template, be sure that the subnet to which the SQL VMs are being deployed already exists on the specified Azure virtual network, AND this subnet should be defined in Active Directory Sites and Services for the appropriate AD site in which the closest domain controllers are configured.

+ To deploy the required Azure VNET and Active Directory infrastructure, if not already in place, you may use <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/active-directory-new-domain-ha-2-dc">this template</a>.
