  "description": "This deployment creates a CSR with 2 NICs, placed in an existing virtualNetwork.  The virutal network must have at least 2 subnets.  User defined routes are created on the subnets to ensure the CSR is used as the default gateway for virtual machines in the private subnet. Finally, the IP Forwarding flag is set on Azure to allow the CSR to properly pass traffic.  To deploy this template to Azure Government, go to the Quickstart repository via the Browse on GitHub button.",
