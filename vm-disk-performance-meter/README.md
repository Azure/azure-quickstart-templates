This template allows you to run a data disk performance test using fio utility.

Upon template deployment you will have the disk perfomance automatically measured. You can see the measurements like this:

```powershell
OutputsString           : 
                          Name             Type                       Value     
                          ===============  =========================  ==========
                          testresult       String                     read: io=65392KB, bw=102980KB/s, iops=25744, runt=635msec; write: io=65680KB, bw=103433KB/s, iops=25858, runt=635msec;
```

Even though automatic test has pre-warmup, subsequent performance measurements can have different results. To re-measure and get full ouput you can login to the test VM with credentials you provided during deployment and use this a command like this:

```shell
sudo echo -e '[io]\nrw=randrw\nsize=128m\ndirectory=/datadisk' | sudo fio -

```

In case you don't need to re-measure, it is safe to delete the created resource group.
