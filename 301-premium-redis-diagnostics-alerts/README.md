This template showcases how to provision Premium Redis Cache with a StaticIP in a given VNET/Subnet. It also showcases how to configure Redis Diagnostics and how to enable Alerts. The template only showcases couple of Redis Alerts, but you can add additional alerts according to your needs.

Note: Note that when you enable Diagnostics for one Redis cache, all other Redis cache(s) in the same subscription will inherit the same settings.
