# Readme
This template creates a multi-server Cloudera CDH 5.4.x Apache Hadoop deployment on CentOS virtual machines, and configures the CDH installation for either POC or high availability production cluster.

The template also provisions storage accounts, virtual network, availability set, network interfaces, VMs, disks and other infrastructure and runtime resources required by the installation.

The template expects the following parameters:

| Name   | Description | Default Value |
|:--- |:---|:---|
| adminUsername  | Administrator user name used when provisioning virtual machines | testuser |
| adminPassword  | Administrator password used when provisioning virtual machines | Eur32#1e |
| cmUsername | Cloudera Manager username | cmadmin |
| cmPassword | Cloudera Manager password | cmpassword |
| storageAccountPrefix | Unique namespace for the Storage Account where the Virtual Machine's disks will be placed | defaultStorageAccountPrefix |
| numberOfDataNodes | Number of data nodes to provision in the cluster | 3 |
| dnsNamePrefix | Unique public dns name where the Virtual Machines will be exposed | defaultDnsNamePrefix |
| region | Azure data center location where resources will be provisioned |  |
| masterStorageAccountType | The type of the Storage Account to be created for master nodes | Premium_LRS |
| workerStorageAccountType | The type of the Storage Account to be created for worker nodes | Standard_LRS |
| virtualNetworkName | The name of the virtual network provisioned for the deployment | clouderaVnet |
| subnetName | Subnet name for the virtual network where resources will be provisioned | clouderaSubnet |
| subnet1Name | Subnet name for the virtual network where resources will be provisioned | tableauSubnet |
| tshirtSize | T-shirt size of the Cloudera cluster (Eval, Prod) | Eval |
| vmSize | The size of the VMs deployed in the cluster (Defaults to Standard_DS14) | Standard_DS14 |

Topology
--------

The deployment topology is comprised of a predefined number (as per t-shirt sizing) Cloudera member nodes configured as a cluster, configured using a set number of manager,
name and data nodes. Typical setup for Cloudera uses 3 master nodes with as many data nodes are needed for the size that has been choosen ranging from as
few as 3 to thousands of data nodes.  The current template will scale at the highest end to 200 data nodes when using the large t-shirt size.

The following table outlines the deployment topology characteristics for each supported t-shirt size:

| T-Shirt Size | Member Node VM Size | CPU Cores | Memory | Data Disks | # of Master Node VMs | Services Placement of Master Node |
|:--- |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Eval | Standard_DS14 | 16 | 112 GB | 10x1000 GB | 1 | 1 (primary, secondary, cloudera manager) |
| Prod | Standard_DS14 | 10 | 112 GB | 10x1000 GB | 3 | 1 primary, 1 standby (HA), 1 cloudera manager |

##Connecting to the cluster
The machines are named according to a specific pattern.  The master node is named based on parameters and using the.

	[dnsNamePrefix]-mn0.[region].cloudapp.azure.com

If the dnsNamePrefix was clouderatest in the West US region, the machine will be located at:

	clouderatest-mn0.westus.cloudapp.azure.com

The rest of the master nodes and data nodes of the cluster use the same pattern, with -mn and -dn extensions followed by their number.  For example:

    clouderatest-mn0.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
	clouderatest-mn1.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
	clouderatest-mn2.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
	clouderatest-dn0.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
	clouderatest-dn1.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
	clouderatest-dn2.westus.cloudapp.azure.com

To connect to the master node via SSH, use the username and password used for deployment

	ssh testuser@[dnsNamePrefix]-mn0.[region].cloudapp.azure.com

Once the deployment is complete, you can navigate to the Cloudera portal to watch the operation and track its status. Be aware that the portal dashboard will report alerts since the services are still being installed.

	http://[dnsNamePrefix]-mn0.[region].cloudapp.azure.com:7180

##Loading sample data and viewing it with a Tableau dashboard (optional)
- Sample data can be loaded into Cloudera Impala and viewed via a Tableau dashboard.
- The following steps can only be executed after all Cloudera and Tableau servers have deployed successfully. 

To generate and load the sample data, connect to the "-mn0" Cloudera master node (referenced above) using PuTTY or another SSH client tool.  Execute the following commands via the command line:

- sudo su - hdfs
- wget https://clouderatableau.blob.core.windows.net/datagen/datagen.tar.gz
- tar -zxf datagen.tar.gz
- cd datagen
- sh datagen.sh 2

Next, connect to the "-dn0" Cloudera worker node (referenced above) using PuTTY or another SSH client tool.  Execute the following commands via the command line:

- sudo su - hdfs
- wget https://clouderatableau.blob.core.windows.net/datagen/datagen.tar.gz
- tar -zxf datagen.tar.gz
- cd datagen
- sh load_data.sh

The sample data should now be accessible in Hadoop Hive (tpch_text_2 database) and Cloudera Impala (tpch_parquet database).

Next, using the Microsoft Azure portal, remote into the Tableau server using the "Connect" button for the Tableau Virtual Machine (VM).  This will establish an RDP session into the Tableau Windows Server.  Follow the registration process and enter the appropriate Tableau license key.  This step must be completed before the dashboard can be deployed.

To complete the process of viewing the Cloudera Impala sample data with a Tableau dashboard, install the Cloudera Impala driver for Windows on the Tableau server:

- Navigate to http://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/impala/odbc.html and select the Windows 64-bit driver.  Follow the registration process and download the driver.
- Copy the driver file to the Tableau server and double-click on it to install.
- Download the sample Tableau dashboard from: https://github.com/jreid143/ClouderaTableau/blob/master/ClouderaTableau/tableau/Cloudera%20Widget%20Dashboard.twbx
- Using Tableau Desktop, deploy the "Cloudera Widget Dashboard.twbx" file to the Tableau Server "Tableau Samples" project.
- Click on the "Cloudera Widget Dashboard" under the "Tableau Samples" project to view the Cloudera Impala sample data.

##Notes, Known Issues & Limitations
- All nodes in the cluster have a public IP address.
- The deployment script is not yet idempotent and cannot handle updates (although it currently works for initial provisioning only)
- SSH key is not yet implemented and the template currently takes a password for the admin user

Any notice or communication required or permitted to be given hereunder must be in writing signed or authorized by the party giving notice, and may be delivered by hand, deposited with an overnight courier, sent by confirmed email, confirmed facsimile or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case to the address below or at such other address as may hereafter be furnished in accordance with this Section. No modification, addition or deletion, or waiver of any rights under this Agreement will be binding on a party unless made in an agreement clearly understood by the parties to be a modification or waiver and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party. No failure or delay (in whole or in part) on the part of a party to exercise any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof or effect any other right or remedy. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided hereunder or by law. The waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
