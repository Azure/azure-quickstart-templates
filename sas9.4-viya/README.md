## Solution Summary
This QuickStart is intended to help SAS® customers deploy a cloud-native environment that provides both SAS® 9.4 platform and the SAS® Viya® 3.5 platform in an integrated environment. It is intended to provide an easy way for customers to get a comprehensive SAS environment, that will likely result in faster migrations and deployments into the Microsoft® Azure environment. The SAS ecosystem is deployed on the Azure platform, leveraging Azure native deployment approaches. As part of the deployment, you get all the powerful data management, analytics, and visualization capabilities of SAS, deployed on a high-performance infrastructure.


### Objective
The SAS 9.4 & Viya QuickStart for Azure will take a SAS provided license package for SAS 9.4, Viya and deploy a well-architected SAS platform into the customer’s Azure subscription. The deployment creates a virtual network and other required infrastructure. After the deployment process completes, you will have the necessary details for the endpoints and connection details to log in to the new SAS Ecosystem. By default, QuickStart deployments enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication


### Architecture Overview
The QuickStart will setup the following environment on Microsoft Azure:
* A Virtual Network (VNet) configured with public and private subnets. This provides the network infrastructure for your SAS 94 and SAS Viya deployments.
* In the public subnet, a Linux bastion host acting as an Ansible Controller Host.
* In the private subnet, a Remote Desktop instance acting as a Client Machine.
* In the Application subnets (private subnet), Virtual Machines for:
	* **SAS 9.4**  – Metadata, Compute, and Mid-Tier Servers
	* **SAS Viya** – Microservices, SPRE, Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) Controller, and CAS Workers Servers
* Disks required for SAS Binaries, Configuration, and Data will be provisioned using Premium Disks in Azure.
* Security groups for Virtual Machines and Subnets.
* Accelerated Networking is enabled on all the network interfaces.
* All the servers are placed in the same proximity placement group.


### Architecture Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](images/sas94-viya-architecture-diagram.svg)

#### SAS 9.4 Components
SAS® 9.4 QuickStart bootstraps the infrastructure for a 3 machine SAS 9.4 environment consisting of:

 * 1 x SAS Metadata Server
 * 1 x SAS Compute Server
 * 1 x SAS Mid-Tier Server
 * 1 x Windows RDP Machine (For accessing thick clients)

It also deploys the SAS Software stack in the machines and performs post-installation steps to validate and secure the mid-tier for encrypted communication. The template will also install SAS desktop clients like SAS® Enterprise Guide®, SAS® Enterprise Miner™, SAS® Data Integration Studio, and SAS® Management Console on the Windows RDP Machine.

#### SAS Viya Components
SAS Viya Quick Start bootstraps the infrastructure required for SAS Viya MPP system consisting of: 

 * 1 x Ansible Controller (acts as Bastion Host)
 * 1 x Microservices
 * 1 x CAS Controller
 * n x CAS Worker Nodes (Number to be specified by user while launching Quick Start)

The template will run with pre-requisites to install SAS Viya on these servers and then deploy SAS Viya on the system.

## Cost and Licenses
The user is responsible for the cost of the Azure Cloud services used while running this QuickStart deployment. There is no additional cost for using the QuickStart. You will need a SAS license (emailed from SAS for SAS 9.4 and SAS Viya) to launch this QuickStart. Your SAS account team can advise on the appropriate software licensing and sizing to meet the workload and performance needs. SAS software is typically licensed on maximum number of physical cores for the computational engine.

In Azure, instance sizes are based on virtual CPUs (vcpus) which equates to 2 vcpus per physical core. We provide recommended instance types and sizes, based on physical cores, as a starting point for this deployment. It is important to use server types that support Accelerated Networking and Premium Storage features. You may choose to use larger instances as recommended by SAS sizing guidelines, but we recommend using the instance series noted.


### SAS 9.4 Sizing
Here are some recommended Machine Types for SAS 9.4 environment:

For **Metadata Server**, We recommend **Standard_D8s_v3**

For **Compute Server**, choose from this list, based on the number of physical cores you have licensed:

| Licensed Cores  |	Virtual Machine   | SKU	Memory (RAM)  |	Temporary Storage |
| --------------- | ----------------  | ----------------- | ----------------- |

## Additional Deployment Details

### User Accounts
The default *vmuser* host operating system account is created during deployment. Use this account to log in via SSH to any of the machines. 

SAS External Users such sasinst is used for SAS 9.4 Installation. Create SAS Account to access the application once the deployment is finished.

SAS Users for Viya such sas and cas are created during the deployment. These are the default user accounts for logging in SAS Viya. You cannot directly log on to the host operationg system with these accounts. 

SAS Viya boot user account *sasboot* can be used to login to the application. You will have the URL to reset the password of *sasboot* useraccount from the outputs section on the successful deployment of the Quickstart. 

**Note:** You need to bind your servers and SAS Viya Application with an LDAP Server.


## Usage

### Remote Desktop Login
1.	SSH to the Ansible bastion host with the *vmuser* user.
```
ssh vmuser@<AnsibleControllerIP>
```
2.  From the Azure Bastion Server, connect to any of the VM instances as vmuser. Passwordless SSH has been set up by default to all the servers from Ansible Controller VM.
```
ssh root@<anyvmserver>
```
3.  Create an RDP tunnel through the bastion host. See the Appendix section for Tunneling instructions.
4.	RDP to the Windows Server using the user(vmuser) and password (SAS External Password parameter value).

### Accessing SAS 9.4 Application
The SAS 9.4 clients such as **SAS Enterprise Guide, DI Studio, SAS Enterprise Miner,** and **SAS Management Console** are installed on the Windows RDP. Log in to these applications using the sasdemo user. The password would be the one you specified in the template under the “SAS External Password parameter value.” 

### Accessing SAS Viya Application
The SAS Viya Web applications can be accessed through the Web Brower on the RDP and directly through your browser via SSH Tunnel. See the Appendix section for Tunneling instructions.

## Troubleshooting
If your deployment fails:
* Check to ensure that all the parameters values that are provided are correct and valid.
* Verify the downloaded SASDepot and Viya Mirro repositories are correct.
* Verify the Premium FileShare created in the storage account is accessible to all virtual machines.
* Review the failed deployment steps and see ["Deployment errors"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-common-deployment-errors#deployment-errors) in the Azure troubleshooting documentation.
*   In general, issues that occur in the primary deployment but do not originate from a sub-deployment are platform issues such as the inability to obtain sufficient resources in a timely manner. In these cases, you must redeploy your software. When the deployment is run via the CLI, the primary deployment is called "azure-deploy". When the deployment is run via the UI template, the primary deployment is called "Microsoft.Template". The names of sub-deployments usually begin with "Phase#".

### Review the Log Files
Ansible is the primary virtual machine that is used for the installation. Most of the deployment log files reside on the Ansible virtual machine.
#### Ansible Server Log Files:
The /var/log/sas/install directory is the primary deployment log directory. Other logs follow:
* runAnsiblePhase*.log files: logs that are produced by the extensions 
* /etc/facters/facts.d/variables.txt: a listing of the parameters supplied to the start scripts.


#### Review SAS 9.4 Services Log Files
* The SAS 9.4 Services Log files are in this parent directory: /opt/sas/config/Lev1.
* The location for each SAS 9.4 Service can be computed from [here](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=bisag&docsetTarget=p1ausbmrrybuynn1xnxb6jmdfarz.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en)
* Refer to this SAS Note for locating SAS Log files in SAS 9.4 environment: https://support.sas.com/kb/55/426.html


#### Review SAS Viya Services Log Files
* /var/log/sas: parent folder for SAS Viya application logs. If there is a startup issue after installation, the information in these logs might be helpful.


### Restart SAS 9.4 Services
SAS 9.4 Services need to be stopped and started in a particular order to avoid any consequences or issues while accessing the application. 
##### Stop/Start SAS Services
The services need to be stopped/restarted on mid-tier server, compute server, and metadata server in the order using the below command
```
    /opt/sas/config/Lev1/sas.services stop
    /opt/sas/config/Lev1/sas.services restart
```
If the services are stopped, then they need to be started on the metadata server, compute server, and mid-tier server in the order using the below command
```
    /opt/sas/config/Lev1/sas.services start
```

### Restart SAS Viya Services
While all the services can be started on each box independently, the Viya-Ark toolkit provides an efficient way to restart all the services across all the boxes from the Ansible controller.

#### Checking the status of the services through Viya-Ark
Viya-Ark can check the status of the services by issuing the following commands as the vmuser on the Ansible controller:
```
cd /sas/install/ansible/sas_viya_playbook/
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-status.yml
```

#### Restarting the services through Viya-Ark
Viya-Ark can restart all of the services by issuing the following commands as the vmuser on the Ansible controller:
```
cd /sas/install/ansible/sas_viya_playbook/
ansible-playbook viya-ark/playbooks/viya-mmsu/viya-services-restart.yml -e enable_stray_cleanup=true
```


## Appendix

#### Configure PAM for SAS Studio
Because SAS Studio does not use the SAS Logon Manager, it has different requirements for integration with an LDAP system. SAS Studio manages authentication through a pluggable authentication module (PAM). You can use System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) to integrate the PAM configuration on your services machine with your LDAP system. To access SAS Studio, the following conditions must be met:


### Appendix A SSH Tunneling
Port forwarding via SSH (SSH tunneling) creates a secure connection between your local computer and a remote machine through which services can be accessed.
##### Step 1
In your PuTTY configuration, configure the Public IP address and Port of your Ansible-Controller/Bastion Host Server. Ansible Controller IP and user details will be available in deployment output in the Azure portal

![](images/pubip_port.jpg)

##### Step 2: 
In the SSH section, browse and select the vmuser private key.

![](images/vmuser_ppk.jpg)


##### Step 3: 
In the SSH section, select the Tunnels option and configure the RDP server private IP (ARM templates outputs) with 3389 port and source port as 50001(Random port in between 50001-60001) and click on Add.

![](images/source_destination.jpg)

##### Step 4: 
Make sure the entry has been correctly added, as shown below:

![](images/forward_ports.jpg)

##### Step 5: 
Once all the configuration is updated, save the configuration and click on Open.

![](images/configuration.jpg)

##### Step 6: 
Open an RDP connection and enter your local IP (127.0.0.1), along with the local port (i.e., Step3 Source Port) in PuTTY. The username will be (vmuser) and the password (SAS External Password Parameter Value).

## Appendix B Security Considerations
#### Network Security Groups
SAS Quickstart for Azure uses the following network security groups to control access to the servers from sources outside the virtual network. All server to server communication between subnets in the SAS  virtual network is permitted.

| Name          | Ingress Rules | Egress Rules  | Servers/Subnets | Notes         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------   | ------------- |
| Public Subnet NSG | Allow port 22/tcp from CIDR prefix specified in the "Admin Ingress Location" parameter |	Allow All | Public Subnet |	Only allowed external connections can be directly made to the servers in public Subnet. |
| Private Subnet NSG |	Deny All |	Allow All | Private Subnet | No external connections can be directly made to the servers in private Subnet. |
| Ansible NSG  | Allow port 22/tcp from CIDR prefix specified in the "Admin Ingress Location" parameter. Deny all others.| Allow All  | Ansible |Ansible/bastion server can be connected to through SSH only.   |
| RDP NSG  |  Deny all | Allow All  |  Windows RDP | No external connections can be directly made to the server.   |
| Metadata NSG  |  Deny all | Allow All  | SAS 9.4 Metadata | No external connections can be directly made to the server.   |
