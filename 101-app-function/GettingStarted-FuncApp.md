# Azure Functions App

This time we will deploy a **Function App**. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.  

With a **Function App** you also deploy a hosting Web Plan and a Storage account. The WebPlan is settled for Consumption. For more information about hosting Plans click [here!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale)  

And the Storage Account is for General Purpose **Standard_LRS**, for more information about Storage Accounts, click [here!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview)

## How Functions App works in Azure

Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. Functions can make development even more productive, and you can use your development languages of choice, such as C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, and Python. Pay only for the time your code runs and trust Azure to scale as needed. Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure.

## What can I do with Functions

Functions are a great solution for processing data, integrating systems, working with the internet-of-things (IoT), and building simple APIs and microservices. Consider Functions for tasks like image or order processing, file maintenance, or for any tasks that you want to run on a schedule.

## How much does Functions cost

Azure Functions has two kinds of pricing plans. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

- **Consumption plan** - When your function runs, Azure provides all of the necessary computational resources. You don't have to worry about resource management, and you only pay for the time that your code runs.
- **App Service plan** - Run your functions just like your web apps. When you are already using App Service for your other applications, you can run your functions on the same plan at no additional cost.

### The Template

The parameter you need to inform is:

Parameter         | Suggested value     | Description
:--------------- | :-------------      |:---------------------
**funcName** |*location**name**enviroment* i.e.:  uksmyfunctiontst  | The unique name of Function App. I recommend you to use the notation above, which helps to create a unique name for your Web Application. The name must use alphanumeric and underscore characters only. There is a 35 character limit to this field. The App name cannot be changed once the bot is created.

## Deployment

There are a few ways to deploy this template.
You can use [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-cli), [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-deploy-portal) or your favorite SDK.

For this task, I'm using Visual Code with CLI extension and the portal. There is little surprise for you at the end of this tutorial.

For Azure CLI I'm using the Visual Code with Azure CLI extensions, if you like, you can find more information [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/extensions). But bare in mind that you don't need to use the Visual Code, you can stick with the old good always present **Command Line** on Windows or any **bash terminal**.

### Using Azure CLI with Visual Code

type on the terminal window: **az login**

![Screen](./images/azlogin.png)

You will be redirected to the Azure Portal where you can insert your credentials and log in.

After logged in, you can see your credentials on the terminal.

To to set the right subscription, you can use the following command:

#### az account set --subscription "your subscription id"

![Screen](./images/azsetsub.png)

### Resource Group

Now you need a Resource Group for our deployment. If you haven't yet created a Resource Group, you can do that now. If you are new on Azure and wonder what is a Resource Group? Bare with me! A Resource Group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. Simply saying, it's like a folder that contains files. Simple as that.

To create a Resource Group, you need a name and a location for your Resource Group.

For a list of locations, type: **az account list-locations**

To create the Resource group, type the command:

#### az group create --name "resource-group" --location "your location"

![Screen](./images/azgroup.png)

Super simple, right? Now that you have a **Resource Group** created, let's deploy the Function App.

#### az group deployment create --name "name of your deployment" --resource-group "resource-group" --template-file "./azuredeploy.json"

![Screen](./images/azdeploy.png)

Insert the values for the parameters.
As you can see, it's running.

![Screen](./images/azdeploy2.png)

Go grab a cup of coffee, have some fresh air. Before you come back you will have your Function App.

And there we go, your deployment is Succeeded:

![Screen](./images/azdeploy3.png)

Let's check the resource at the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

On the portal, go to Resource Groups. On this blade, you can see the Resource Group that you created.

Click on the Resource Group and there it's the resources **Resources**:

- App Service plan
- Storage Account
- App Service

![Screen](./images/azdeployportal.png)

Click on the App Service and you have an overview of your **Function App**.

![Screen](./images/azdeployportal2.png)

And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Now you can practice with your functions.

And the most important, don't forget to have fun!

### Using the Portal

At the Portal, in All Services look for **Templates**, you can favorite this service.

Click in **Add** to add your template:

On General, type the name and the description for your template, and click on [OK].

![Screen](./images/aztemplate2.png)

On ARM Template, replace the contents of the template with yours, and click on [OK].

![Screen](./images/aztemplate3.png)

Click on the refresh button and you there is your template. Click on it and then click in [Deploy]

![Screen](./images/azportaldeploy.png)

On the screen Custom Deployment, inform the values for the parameters, by now you must be already familiar with.

Select [I agree] and click on [Purchase].

![Screen](./images/azportaldeploy2.png)

As you can see, it's deploying.

After a couple of minutes, voil√†, you have your Function App deployed.

![Screen](./images/azportaldeploy3.png)

Go to the Resource. Repeat the test you have done before and enjoy your coding.

**p.s.: Pretty easy to create resources on Azure, right? But if you are the sort of IT guy that always loves automation, here is the surprise. Just click on the button below and it will automatically deploy the VM through the  Azure Portal.**

</a>

#### Important disclaimer: Azure charges you for the resources you are using, and you don't want to finish all your credits at once, right? So, don't forget to stop the Function App at the portal or even delete the Resource Group you have created to avoid unnecessary charges

### How to shutdown your resources

#### Using the portal

On the portal, go to your Resource Group, if you will not use the Function App anymore, you can just click on the [Delete] Button.

You can also just stop the Function App if you want to keep the resource. Open the resource and click on Stop.

![Screen](./images/off.png)

Just refresh your screen and you are good to go.
