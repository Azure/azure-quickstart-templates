This template deploys a WordPress site in [App service Linux(preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-linux-readme) with ClearDB MySQL database. 

Note:

1. App Service on Linux is currently in Public Preview and enables customers to run their web apps natively on a Linux platform.
2. Public Preview pricing for App Service on Linux is 50% of the regular price, and the price is calculated by halving the number of compute-hours consumed by your App Service Plan. No SLA is offered during the public preview period.
3. [ClearDB](http://w2.cleardb.net/azure/) is a third party MySQL PaaS service. In order to use this service you may need a credit card enabled on your Azure subscription.
