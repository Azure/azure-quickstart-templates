# ARM Template to Create and provision new Windows Virtual Desktop hostpool

This ARM template only supports Azure Resource Manager Windows Virtual Desktop objects, and does not support Windows Virtual Desktop (classic). Information on ARM Templates for Windows Virtual Desktop (classic) is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/virtual-desktop-fall-2019/create-host-pools-arm-template).

This template creates virtual machines and registers them as session hosts to a new or existing Windows Virtual Desktop host pool. There are multiple sets of parameters you must enter to successfully deploy the template:
- VM image
- VM configuration
- Domain and network properties

Follow the guidance below for entering the appropriate parameters for your scenario.

You can open [an issue](https://github.com/Azure/rds-templates/issues) and add the label **1-Create-and-provision-host-pool-arm** to associate it with this tool.

## VM image
When creating the virtual machines, you have three options:
- Azure Gallery image
- Custom VHD from blob storage
- Custom Azure Image resource from a resource group

Enter the appropriate parameters depending on the image option you choose.

### Azure Gallery Image
By selecting Azure Gallery Image, you can select up-to-date images provided by Microsoft and other publishers. Enter or select values for the following parameters:
- **Rdsh Image Source**, select **Gallery**.
- **Rdsh Gallery Image SKU**

Ignore the following parameters:
- **Vm Image Vhd Uri**
- **Rdsh Custom Image Source Name**
- **Rdsh Custom Image Source Resource Group**
- **Rdsh Use Managed Disks**
- **Storage Account Resource Group Name**

### Custom VHD from blob storage
By selecting a custom VHD from blob storage, you can create your own image locally through Hyper-V or on an Azure VM. Enter or select values for the following parameters:
- **Rdsh Image Source**, select **CustomVHD**.
- **Vm Image Vhd Uri**
- **Rdsh Use Managed Disks**. If you select **false** for **Rdsh Use Managed Disks**, enter the name of the resource group containing the storage account and image for the **Storage Account Resource Group Name** parameter. Otherwise, leave the **Storage Account Resource Group Name** parameter empty.
  
  > [!WARNING]
  **Rdsh Use Managed Disks** will **not** be allowed to be **false**, starting **March 1st, 2020**.

Ignore the following parameters:
- **Rdsh Gallery Image SKU**
- **Rdsh Custom Image Source Name**
- **Rdsh Custom Image Source Resource Group**

### Custom Azure Image resource from a resource group
By selecting a custom Azure Image resource from a resource group, you can create your own image locally through Hyper-V or an Azure VM but have the portability and flexibility of image management through an Azure Image resource. Enter or select values for the following parameters:
- **Rdsh Image Source**, select **CustomImage**.
- **Rdsh Custom Image Source Name**
- **Rdsh Custom Image Source Resource Group**

Ignore the following parameters:
- **Vm Image Vhd Uri**
- **Rdsh Gallery Image SKU**
- **Rdsh Use Managed Disks**
- **Storage Account Resource Group Name**

## VM configuration
Enter the remaining configuration parameters for the virtual machines.
- **Vm Size**
- **Enable Accelerated Networking**. Please notice that VM size must support it, this is supported in most of general purpose and compute-optimized instances with 2 or more vCPUs, on instances that supports hyperthreading it is required minimum of 4 vCPUs. Default value is `false`.
- **Rdsh Name Prefix**
  > [!WARNING]
  Starting from **June 1st 2020**, the default value for this parameter will be removed, so the value will need to be specified.
- **Rdsh Number Of Instances**
- **Rdsh VM Disk Type**. If you selected **CustomVHD** as the **Rdsh Image Source** and **false** for **Rdsh Use Managed Disks**, ensure that this parameter matches the storage account type where the source image is located.

## Domain and network properties
Enter the following properties to connect the virtual machines to the appropriate network and join them to the appropriate domain (and organizational unit, if defined).

- **Domain To Join**
- **Existing Domain UPN**. This UPN must have appropriate permissions to join the virtual machines to the domain and organizational unit.
- **Existing Domain Password**
- **OU Path**. If you do not have a specific organizaiton unit for the virtual machines to join, leave this parameter empty.
- **Existing Vnet Name**
- **Existing Subnet Name**
- **Virtual Network Resource Group Name**

## Windows Virtual Desktop host pool type
The following property will change the default template behavior from setting up a non-persistent environment to persistent if changed to True.

- **Enable Persistent Desktop**. Default value is False, change to True to create the host pool with persistent desktops.
