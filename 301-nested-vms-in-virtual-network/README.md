This template will automate the deployment of a Virtual Machine to be a Hyper-V Host to be used for nested virtualization. Nested Virtual Machines will be able to communicate out to the internet and to other resources on your network.

The setup is completed based on the procedure from the article [Nested VMs in Azure Virtual Networks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization-azure-virtual-network)

This template creates the following resources by default:

+    Virtual Network with four Subnets
+    Virtual Machine to be the Hyper-V Host
+    Public IP Address for remote access to Hyper-V Host
+    Network Security Groups with Default Rules
+    Route Table for Azure Virtual Machines to communicate with nested Virtual Machines
+    DSC Extension to install Windows Features
+    Custom Script Extension to configure Hyper-V Server

## Final Configuration

The environment in this guide has the below configurations. This section is intended to be used as a reference.

1. Azure Virtual Network Information.
    + VNet High Level Configuration.
        + Name: Nested-Fun
        + Address Space: 10.0.0.0/22
        + Note: This will be made up of four Subnets. Also, these ranges are not set in stone. Feel free to address your environment however you want.

    + First Subnet High Level Configuration.
        + Name: NAT
        + Address Space: 10.0.0.0/24
        + Note: This is where our Hyper-V hosts primary NIC resides. This will be used to handle outbound NAT for the nested VMs. It will be the gateway to the internet for your nested VMs.

    + Second Subnet High Level Configuration.
        + Name: Hyper-V-LAN
        + Address Space: 10.0.1.0/24
        + Note:  Our Hyper-V host will have a second NIC that will be used to handle the routing between the nested VMs and non-internet resources external to the Hyper-V host.

    + Third Subnet High Level Configuration.
        + Name: Ghosted
        + Address Space: 10.0.2.0/24
        + Note:  This will be a “floating” subnet. The address space will be consumed by our nested VMs and exists to handle route advertisements back to on-premises. No VMs will actually be deployed into this subnet.

    + Fourth Subnet High Level Configuration.
        + Name: Azure-VMs
        + Address Space: 10.0.3.0/24
        + Note: Subnet containing Azure VMs.

2. Our Hyper-V host has the below NIC configurations.
    + Primary NIC
        + IP Address: 10.0.0.4
        + Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        + Default Gateway: 10.0.0.1
        + DNS: Configured for DHCP
        + IP Forwarding Enabled: No

    + Secondary NIC
        + IP Address: 10.0.1.4
        + Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        + Default Gateway: Empty
        + DNS: Configured for DHCP
        + IP Forwarding Enabled: Yes

    + Hyper-V Created NIC for Internal Virtual Switch
        + IP Address: 10.0.2.1
        + Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        + Default Gateway: Empty

3. Our Route Table will have a single rule.
    + Rule 1
        + Name: Nested-VMs
        + Destination: 10.0.2.0/24
        + Next Hop: Virtual Appliance - 10.0.1.4

## Post Deployment Steps

Once the deployment is complete to access your Hyper-V Host an inbound security rule will need to be created on your NAT Subnet NSG.

Beyond this the solution does support network communication between on-premises resources and the nested virtual machines. To achieve this route tables will need to be created on the GatewaySubnet and additional routes created in RRAS on the Hyper-V Host

## Notes

+ If you are going to modify and use existing Virtual Networks, NSGs or any NVAs outbound internet access is required for Hyper-V Host Virtual Machines for setup to complete.
