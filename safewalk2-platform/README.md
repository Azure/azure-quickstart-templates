## Solution overview and deployed resources

**Safewalk** is an **Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution** with focus on (2FA) Strong authentication.

This document includes a general overview and quick installation instructions for a single topology that is the most commonly used. For more advanced configuration, administration and maintenance of the system as well as known issues and troubleshooting please refer to the full user manual.

The following resources are deployed as part of the solution

### Virtual Network Layout
The virtual network will consists on three subnets:
* DMZ subnet - This subnet is accesible from the Internet using a Public static IP. It contains the Gateway VM which is regulated with the DMZ Network Security Group.
* LAN subnet - This subnet only allows internal access and only permitted ports are accesible from the DMZ subnet.
* Gateway Subnet - This subnet is a well known predefined Azure one and can be used to create virtual network connections like **vNet<->vNet** or **Point<->Site** VPN connections.

#### Safewalk server VM
The Safewalk server VM is installed inside the LAN subnet. It's recommended to access it using a VPN. If cluster is enabled, 2 VMs will be created in the same Availability Set (different physical machines).

* Super-Admin Console
A web based interface that provides access to the general configuration of the system, like LDAP/AD connectivity to users or groups, import of new licenses, creating RADIUS clients and more. The main idea of this interface is to provide access for the highest authority to perform tasks that are not needed on a day to day basis and require a relatively high level of knowledge with the system and the organization architecture.

* Management Console
A web based interface that provides access to manage users, their authentication settings, view transactions and more. The main idea of this interface is to provide access for helpdesk personnel or system administrators to perform tasks that are needed frequently but has no system-wide impact.

* Self-Service Portal
A web based interface that provides access to end users to register their authentication device.

* RADIUS Server
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users that connect and use a network service. The Remote Access Server, the Virtual Private Network server, the Network switch with port-based authentication, and the Network Access Server (NAS), are all gateways that control access to the network, and all have a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. RADIUS is often the backend of choice for 802.1X authentication as well (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS for more details).

#### Safewalk Gateway VM
Safewalk-Gateway is a complementary component to the Safewalk Server with the purpose of providing additional services like Single sign-on (SSO) that improves the accessibility and integration capabilities with the Safewalk platform as well as to serve as a platform for any additional applications that can be derived from the Safewalk platform.
The Gateway VM will be created at the DMZ subnet.

The main components of the Safewalk Gateway consists of:

* SSO (SAML IdP v2)
Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) and integration with third party web-based applications over the SAML v2 standard protocol.

Single Single sign-on (SSO) is provided across all the SAML applications that are integrated with the same Safewalk Gateway.

Benefits of using single sign-on include:

* Mitigate risk for access to 3rd-party sites (user passwords not stored or managed externally)
* Reducing password fatigue from different user name and password combinations
* Reducing time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity
* Reducing IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords

General SAML authentication flow
1. User generates a code (be it its static password, One-Time-Password from a mobile app/email/sms or from
a physical device);
2. User browses to the the application (that is enabled as a SAML SP);
3. The application redirects the user to its configured SAML IdP (i.e. the Safewalk Gateway) where the user
is prompted to enter its credentials;
4. The credentials supplied by the user are checked on the Safewalk server;
5. The Safewalk server validates the code and reply with the authentication result (one of AccessAccept/Access-Reject/Access-Challenge);
6. Assuming that the credentials have been verified successfully (i.e. Access-Accept) the user is granted access
to the application;

* Registration-Gateway
For facilitating the over-the-air registration method of mobile applications.

* Safewalk server authentication api
A proxy to the Safewalk server authentication api for external applications that do not support standard authentication protocols.

General authentication flow
1. User generates a code (be it its static password, One-Time-Password from a mobile app/email/sms or from
a physical device);
2. User browses to the address of the organization NAS (that is equipped with a RADIUS client), where he is
prompted to enter its credentials;
3. The credentials supplied by the user are checked on the Safewalk server;
4. The Safewalk server validates the code and return a reply to the NAS (one of Access-Accept/AccessReject/Access-Challenge);
5. Assuming that the credentials have been verified successfully (i.e. Access-Accept) the user is granted access
to the relevant application;

## Prerequisites
To get use this Safewalk2 platform you'll need to copy or upload the VM's VHD images to your storage account.

### Uploading the Safewalk Server and Safewalk Gateway VHD images

The first thing you will need to do before you can deploy Safewalk using the ARM template is to copy or upload the Safewalk Server and Safewalk Gateway VHD images to your Azure subscription by following the steps below:

Login into the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com)

Create or select a blob storage account on the **same region** where you plan to deploy the Safewalk2 framework. It's recommended that the VHD Images live in a separate resource group in case you need to delete/move the system components and keep the images for future deployments.
Then add a container to upload the VHD images into.

Download the images to your local drive from:
<a href="https://safewalk2.blob.core.windows.net/images/Safewalk.vhd">Safewalk VHD image</a>
<a href="https://safewalk2.blob.core.windows.net/images/Gateway2.vhd">Gateway VHD image</a>
and Upload it manually as a Page Blob into your storage account container.
