Skipping CI due as the gateway needs to be downloaded and installed manually in the local vm or computer:

If your template has some pre-requisite such as an Azure Active Directory application or service principal, we don't support this yet.
To bypass the CI workflow include a file called .ci_skip in the root of your template folder.
