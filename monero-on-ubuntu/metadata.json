  "description": "This template deploys a Monero node on an Ubuntu VM. Monero is primarily focused on transactional privacy for users, and is best-suited to developers looking to build on top of Monero's privacy-centric blockchain. This also enables Ubuntu's UFW firewall, and enables automatic security updates, both of which are considered necessary steps to running a secure Monero node. For ease-of-access the Monero node runs in a screen session so that you can easily monitor it.",
