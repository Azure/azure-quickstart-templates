Cryptocurrency and financial systems are the first widely used applications of blockchain technology, but the blockchain and its associated technology can be used for much more.

Nxt revolutionises the financial technology, crowdfunding and governance industries by providing not only the groundbreaking Nxt crypto-currency, but also a powerful, modular toolset to build with in any way Nxt users can imagine. Nxt gives users complete freedom to create their own applications.

# Template parameters

When deploying the solution, you need to specify the following template parameters:

* `adminUsername`: Username for the Ubuntu VM.
* `adminPassword`: Password for the Ubuntu VM. Azure requires passwords to have One upper case, one lower case, a special character, and a number.
* `hostname`: A public DNS name for the VM. It must be unique.
* `vmSize`: Size of the VM.
* `limitAPItoLocalhost`: False - public Nxt API and GUI are available from anywhere. True - public Nxt API and GUI are available only from localhost.
* `testnet`: Run Nxt on Testnet. Testnet is useful for testing without any financial risk. Mainnet is required for final deployment. Keep in mind that testnet uses a different API port: `6876`.
