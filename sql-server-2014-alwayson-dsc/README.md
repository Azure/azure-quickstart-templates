# Create a SQL Server 2014 Always On Availability Group with PowerShell DSC Extension

This template will create a SQL Server 2014 Always On Availability Group using the PowerShell DSC Extension it creates the following resources:

+	A Virtual Network
+	Three Storage Accounts
+	One external and one internal load balancer
+	Two VMs configured as Domain Controllers for a new forest with a single domain
+	Three VMs in a Windows Server Cluster, two VMs run SQL Server 2014 with an availability group and the third is a File Share Witness for the Cluster
+	Two Availability Sets one for the AD VMs, the other for the SQL and Witness VMs, the second Availability Set is configured with three Update Domains and three Fault Domains

The external load balancer creates an RDP NAT rule to allow connectivity to the first VM created, in order to access other VMs in the deployment this VM should be used as a jumpbox.

A SQL Server always on listener is created using the internal load balancer.

# Known Issues

This template is entirely serial due to some issues between the platform agent and the DSC extension which cause problems when multiple VM and\or extension resources are deployed concurrently. This issue will be fixed as soon as possible.

## Notes

+	The default settings for storage are to deploy using **premium storage**, the AD VMs use a P10 Disk and the SQL VMs use two P30 disks each, these sizes can be changed by changing the relevant variables. In addition there is a P10 Disk used for each VMs OS Disk.

+ 	In default settings for compute require that you have at least 19 cores of free quota to deploy.

+ 	The images used to create this deployment are
	+ 	AD - Latest Windows Server 2012 R2 Image
	+ 	SQL Server - Latest SQL Server 2014 on Windows Server 2012 R2 Image
	+ 	Witness - Latest Windows Server 2012 R2 Image

+ 	The image configuration is defined in variables - details below - but the scripts that configure this deployment have only been tested with these versions and may not work on other images.
