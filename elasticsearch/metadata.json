  "description": "This template deploys an Elasticsearch cluster on Virtual Machines and uses template linking to create data node scale units.  The template provisions 3 dedicated master and client nodes in separate availability sets and storage accounts. Data node scale unit count and nodes in a scale unit can be configured as parameters.  A load balancer is configured with a rule to route traffic on port 9200 to the client nodes, and also includes a single SSH nat management rule for a single node.  Multiple data disks are attached and data is striped across them as an approach to improve disk throughput.",
