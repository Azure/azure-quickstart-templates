  "description": "This template deploys an Elasticsearch cluster on Virtual Machines and uses template linking to create master, client, and data nodes.  The template provisions 3 dedicated masters and optional client nodes in separate availability sets. A configurable internal or external load balancer is provisioned to route traffic on port 9200 to the client nodes if they are used and if not it will route traffic to the data nodes.  Multiple data disks are attached and vary depending on the data node SKU size selected to improve disk throughput",
