This template creates a virtual network with 3 subnets (server subnet, jumpbox subnet and AzureFirewall subnet), a jumpbox VM with public IP and RDP access,
A server VM with only a private IP, UDR route to point to AzureFirewall for the ServerSubnet and an AzureFirewall with 1 sample application rule and 1 sample network rule.
Azure Firewall is a managed cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources.
It is a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
You can centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual network.
Azure Firewall uses a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network.
The service is fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics. Learn more at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall.
