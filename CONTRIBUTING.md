# Contributing guide

This is a repo that contains all the currently available Azure Resource Manager templates contributed by the community. These templates are indexed on Azure.com and available to view here http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/templates/

To make sure your template is added to Azure.com index, please follow these guidelines. Any templates that are out of compliance will be added to the **blacklist** and not be indexed on Azure.com

1.	Every template must be contained in its own **folder**. Name this folder something that describes what your template does. Usually this naming pattern looks like **appName-osName**
2.	The template file must be named **azuredeploy.json**
3.	The template folder must host the **scripts** that are needed for successful template execution
4.	The template folder must contain a **metadata.json** file to allow the template to be indexed on [Azure.com](http://azure.microsoft.com)
  *	Guidelines on the metadata file below
5. Include a **Readme.md** file that explains how the template works
6. Template parameters should follow **camelCasing**
7. Every parameter in the template must have the **description** specified using the metadata property. This looks like below

  ```json
  "newStorageAccountName": {
        "type": "string",
        "metadata": {
            "description": "The name of the new storage account created to store the VMs disks"
        }
  }
  ```
  
See the starter template [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/100-starter-template-with-validation) for more information on passing validation


## metadata.json file

Here are the required parameters for a valid metadata.json file

To be more consistent with the Visual Studio and Gallery experience we're updating the metadata.json file structure. The new structure looks like below

    {
      "itemDisplayName": "",
      "description": "",
      "summary": "",
      "githubUsername": "",
      "dateUpdated": "<e.g. 2015-12-20>"
    }

The metadata.json file will be validated using these rules

**itemDisplayName**
*	Cannot be more than 60 characters

**description**
*	Cannot be more than 1000 characters
*	Cannot contain HTML
* This is used for the template description on the Azure.com index template details page

**summary**
*	Cannot be more than 200 characters
* This is shown for template description on the main Azure.com template index page

**githubUsername**
*	Username must be the same as the username of the author submitting the Pull Request
* This is used to display template author and Github profile pic in the Azure.com index

**dateUpdated**
*	Must be in yyyy-mm-dd format.
*	The date must not be in the future to the date of the pull request

## Good practice

* It is a good practice to pass your template through a JSON linter to remove extraneous commas, paranthesis, brackets that may break the "Deploy to Azure" experience
