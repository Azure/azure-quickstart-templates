  "summary": "This template deploys a new Linux VMSS and jumpbox and enables encryption on the data volumes of the Linux VMSS instances.", 
  "description": "This template deploys a Linux VMSS using the latest Linux image, adds data volumes, and then encrypts the data volumes of each Linux VMSS instance.  It also deploys a jumpbox with a public IP address in the same virtual network as the Linux VMSS instances with private IP addresses.  This allows connecting to the jumpbox via its public IP address, and then connecting to the Linux VMSS instances via private IP addresses.",
