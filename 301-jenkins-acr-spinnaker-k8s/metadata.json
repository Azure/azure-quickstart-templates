  "description": "This template allows you to deploy and configure a DevOps pipeline from an Azure Container Registry to a Kubernetes cluster. It deploys an instance of Jenkins on a Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS VM and an instance of Spinnaker on the same Kubernetes cluster that your pipeline will target. The Jenkins instance will include a basic pipeline that checks out a user-provided git repository, builds the Docker container based on the Dockerfile at the root of the repo, and pushes the image to the provisioned Azure Container Registry. The Spinnaker instance will include a basic pipeline that is triggered by any new tag in the registry and deploys the image to the provisioned Kubernetes cluster.",
