>[AZURE.NOTE]This is preliminary documentation for Azure VM Inventory , a management solution you can deploy into OMS that will provide insights of virtual machines across subscriptions. 


Azure VM Inventory  Solution collects and visualizes inventory information of a virtual machine along with ;
* Data and OS disks
* input endpoints for Classic VMs
* NSG Rules for ARM VMs
* VM Extensions
* Virtual Network,Subnet, internal and public IP information. 

Solution also collects overall core usage and other subscription level limits .. This solution leverages Azure Automation, the Log Analytics Ingestion API, together with Log Analytics views to present data about all your virtual machines from different subscriptions  in a single  workspace.

## Pre-reqs

- **Automation Account with SPN**

Before you deploy this template, you must create an Automation Account in the Azure portal with the default settings so that the SPN account will be created. If you have an existing OMS Log Analytics Workspace you would like to use for this solution, it is important that the Automation account is created into the **same Resource Group where the OMS Log Analytics Workspace is located**.

If you **dont** have an existing OMS Log Analytics Workspace, the template will create and deploy this for you.

## Deploying the Azure VM Inventory Solution

### Follow these instructions to deploy the solution into an existing - or new Log Analytics Workspace

Log into Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and ensure you are in the subscription containing the recovery vault you want to monitor

Locate your existing OMS Log Analytics Workspace and note the name of the workspace, the location of the workspace, and the Resource Group

![alt text](images/omsworkspace.png "omsws") 

Next, create a new Automation Account and click on *New* and search for 'Automation'

![alt text](images/createautomation1.png "automation")
 
Select Automation and click *Create* 

Specify the name of the Automation Account and ensure you are selecting 'Use existing' and selects the Resource Group containing the OMS Log Analytics workspace. If possible, use the same Azure Region for the Automation Account. Ensure that 'Create Azure Run As account' is set to 'Yes' and click 'Create'

Once the deployment has completed, you should see the Automation account and the Log Analytics workspace in the same Resource Group

###You can now deploy the template   
[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Foms-azure-vminventory-solution%2Fazuredeploy.json) 

This will send you to the Azure Portal with some default values for the template parameters. 
Ensure that the parameters reflects your setup so that you are deploying this into the *existing* Resource Group containing the Log Analytics Workspace and the Automation account.

#### Please take caution on  OMS workspace SKU and Automation Account SKU as selections might effect the existing deployment.
#### Solution requires a new guid to be created every time  ARM template deployed. Using same guid will cause deployment to fail!

#### Parameters

* OMS Log Analytics Workspace Name

Specify the name of the workspace you want to deploy this solution to

* OMS Log Analytics Region

Select the Azure Region where your existing workspace is located

* OMS Automation Account Name

Specify the name of the automation account you created earlier

* OMS Automation Region

Select the Azure Region where your automation account is located


You should also change the values for the *Ingest Scheduler Guid* and *Ingest Cleanup Guid*. You can generate your own using PowerShell with the following cmdlet:


![alt text](images/knguid.png "guid")

Once you have customized all the parameters, click *Create*

![alt text](images/vminventory_template.png "template")

The ingestion will start 5-10 minutes post deployment.

## Exploring the views

Once the template has successfully been deployed, Azure VM  inventory data ingestion should occur within 15 minutes post deployment.  If you are deploying the solution to a new workspace, it can take approximately 30 minutes before the indexing has completed for the workspace in general. 

In the Resource Group where you deployed the template, you should see the solution resource.

* AzureVMInventory[workspaceName]

### Azure VM Inventory

The views for Azure VM Inventory   will give you an overview of all the VMs  within your Azure Subscription.  Multiple subscriptions can be added to provide overview for all.

### Alerts

Solution has 2 alerts defined ;
VMs in Stopped State  and Azure Subscription Quota Reaching %90  . Additional alerts can be created by using  the inventory collected by the solution.

### Troubleshooting 

Solution relies on Automation Account with Runas Accounts  configured. Both SPN and Classic Certificate is used by the Storage REST API calls.  

![alt text](images/runasaccounts.PNG "Azure Automation Runas Accounts")

General Troubleshooting steps ;
* Make sure you specify a new Guid each time template is deployed
* Check if automation account can start  the runbooks
* Check if Runas Accounts configured properly and has permission to query subscription details and can access storage keys  
* Check if AzureStorageIngestion.......  Automation Schedules are enabled
* Navigate to Resource group , delete AzureVMInventory[workspaceName] solution and redeploy template with a new Guid


## Adding Additional Subscriptions | Partial Deployment 

Deploying all resources in a single resource group is the prefferred way for deploying the solution. But if you have your OMS workspace and Automation account in different resource groups  you can use the partial templates to deploy the solution. 

First deploy the OMS Solution Views by following the link below 

[![Deploy OMS Views](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Foms-azure-vminventory-solution%2Fazuredeployonlyloganalytics.json) 



Second use the link below to deploy the automation components to an existing automation account.

This second template also used to onboard additional subscriptions to the solution !

[![Deploy Automation/ Add Subscriptions](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Foms-azure-vminventory-solution%2Fazuredeployonlyautomation.json) 

Template requires OMS Log Analytics workspace ID and Key  from the  workspace where solution is already deployed. Navigate to Log Analytics Portal / Settings / Connected Sources  to get worspace Id and Key.
This solution will deploy only the automation components used in data collection and push data to existing log analytics workspace.
