# Bloq Enterprise Router on Ubuntu

This template quickly deploys a Bloq Enterprise Router onto Microsoft Azure. After configuring
software the daemon will begin a sync with the Bitcoin network, which can take up to a full 24hr 
to sync.

This deployment downloads packages from the Bloq package repository, and has an upstart script 
that manages the starting/stopping of a Bloq Enterprise node.
