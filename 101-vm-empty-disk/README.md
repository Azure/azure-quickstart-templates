This template allows you to create a Linux Virtual Machine from a specified image during the template deployment and install the VM Diagnostics Extension. It also attaches an empty data disk. This template also deploys a Storage Account, Virtual Network, Public IP addresses and a Network Interface.

NOTE: The configuration of the VM diagnostics extension relies on a Base64 encoded string for the xmlConfig. This configures a basic set of counters, including CPU and Memory. 

Below are the parameters that the template expects.

| Name   | Description    |
|:--- |:---|
| newStorageAccountName  | Unique DNS Name for the Storage Account where the Virtual Machine's disks will be placed. |
| adminUsername  | Username for the Virtual Machines  |
| adminPassword  | Password for the Virtual Machine  |
| dnsNameForPublicIP  | Unique DNS Name for the Public IP used to access the Virtual Machine. |
| vmSize | Size of the Virtual Machine |
| vmDiagnosticsStorageAccountResourceGroup | Name of the resource group containing the Storage Account to place logs in | 
| vmDiagnosticsStorageAccountName | Name of the Storage Account to place logs in |
