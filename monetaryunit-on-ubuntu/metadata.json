  "description": "This template deploys a MonetaryUnit node on an Ubuntu VM. MonetaryUnit is primarily focused on transactional privacy for users, and is best-suited to developers looking to build on top of MonetaryUnit's privacy-centric blockchain. This also enables Ubuntu's UFW firewall, and enables automatic security updates, both of which are considered necessary steps to running a secure MonetaryUnit node. For ease-of-access the MonetaryUnit node runs in a screen session so that you can easily monitor it.",
